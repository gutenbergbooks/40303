<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="sc">My Dear Boys:</span> This is a complete story in
itself, but forms the fifteenth volume of the
&ldquo;Rover Boys Series for Young Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twelve years ago the line was started with the
publication of the first three stories, &ldquo;The Rover
Boys at School,&rdquo; &ldquo;On the Ocean,&rdquo; and &ldquo;In the
Jungle.&rdquo; I earnestly hoped that the young people
would like the tales, but never did I anticipate
the tremendously enthusiastic welcome
which was given to the volumes from the start,
nor the steady sale, ever increasing, which has
been accorded the series up to the present time.
The publication of the first three books immediately
called for a fourth, &ldquo;The Rover Boys Out
West,&rdquo; and then followed yearly &ldquo;On the Great
Lakes,&rdquo; &ldquo;In Camp,&rdquo; &ldquo;On Land and Sea,&rdquo; &ldquo;On
the River,&rdquo; &ldquo;On the Plains,&rdquo; &ldquo;In Southern
Waters,&rdquo; &ldquo;On the Farm,&rdquo; &ldquo;On Treasure Isle,&rdquo;
and then &ldquo;At College,&rdquo; where we last left our
heroes.</p>
<p>Dick, Tom and Sam are older than when we
first made their acquaintance and told how they
went to Putnam Hall. They are now college
boys, attending a well-known institution of learning
in the middle-west. But though older, they
are as lively as ever, and Tom, at least, is just as
full of fun. They have a great struggle to save
the Stanhope fortune, and have to work hard
to get the best of several enemies. They take a
long journey Down East, and their adventures
are both mysterious and exciting.</p>
<p>Again I take this opportunity to thank my
friends, both young and old, for all the nice
things they have said about my books. I am
more than sorry that I cannot answer all the letters
that pour in upon me from everywhere praising
the stories. I earnestly hope the present volume
will please all my readers and do them some
good.</p>
<p class="center">Affectionately and sincerely yours,</p>
<p><span class="jr"><span class="sc">Edward Stratemeyer</span></span></p>

<h1 title="">THE ROVER BOYS DOWN EAST</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">A GAME OF BASEBALL</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! that&rsquo;s the way to do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, Tom, see if you can&rsquo;t bring Dick
home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him a swift one, Frank! Don&rsquo;t let him
hit it!&rdquo; cried Sam Rover, merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll knock it down into the river!&rdquo; retorted
Tom Rover, as he caught up a bat and walked
to the home plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting for you, Tom!&rdquo; sang out Dick
Rover, who had just reached second base on a
beautiful drive to right field. &ldquo;Come now, it&rsquo;s
time we tied the score.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody in the game!&rdquo; yelled Stanley
Browne, who was in the coacher&rsquo;s box. &ldquo;Here
is where we do &rsquo;em up!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get ready to run, Dick!&rdquo; came from Songbird
Powell. &ldquo;Tom is going to land it on the other
side of the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he does that I&rsquo;ll walk home,&rdquo; answered
Dick, with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, here is where Tom misses!&rdquo; called
out Sam, who was behind the bat, and he
thumped his fist in his catcher&rsquo;s mitt. &ldquo;Give him a
double-ender curve, Frank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll give him a regular corkscrew curl,&rdquo;
retorted Frank Holden, who occupied the pitcher&rsquo;s
box. &ldquo;Tom, prepare to die!&rdquo; And he drew
back to pitch the ball.</p>
<p>Eighteen of the students of Brill College
were having a game of baseball on the athletic
field of that institution of learning. The regular
season for baseball was at an end, and the youths
had fixed up their nines to suit themselves, with
Dick Rover as captain of one side and Frank
Holden as captain on the other. On Dick&rsquo;s side
were his brother Tom, and a number of their
chums, while Sam was doing the catching for
Frank.</p>
<p>It was only a friendly contest and all of the
students were in the best of spirits. The main
examinations for the term were practically over,
and in a few days more the students were to
scatter for the summer vacation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>It was the ending of the fourth inning and the
score stood 6 to 4 in favor of Frank Holden&rsquo;s
nine. If Tom should manage to bring both Dick
and himself in it would tie the score. But Tom
was not known for his home-run qualities.</p>
<p>Frank Holden made a signal to Sam and then
sent in a low, swift ball. Tom made a swing at
it. But he was too slow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike one!&rdquo; sang out Will Faley, the umpire.
&ldquo;Try it some more, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the ball came in and this time Tom
struck at it with all his might.</p>
<p>Crack! The ashen stick met the horsehide and
the ball went whizzing off to the right of the
home plate, in the direction of a number of students
who were crossing the grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foul!&rdquo; sang out the umpire, as the sphere
curved through the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get it, Sam!&rdquo; called out Max
Spangler. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too far off already!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, you fellows!&rdquo; yelled Frank, from
the pitcher&rsquo;s box. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he could finish the crowd walking across
the grounds looked up and commenced to scatter,
to give Sam a chance to catch the ball, which had
gone quite high in the air. But before the youngest
Rover could reach the sphere down it came&mdash;straight
on the fancy straw hat of a dudish youth,
crushing the article over its wearer&rsquo;s head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whoop! there&rsquo;s a strike for you, Tom!&rdquo; murmured
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you call that knocking the ball over the
river?&rdquo; demanded Songbird, dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a case where a straw shows how the
ball blows,&rdquo; misquoted Stanley Browne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! hi! what do you mean by smashing my
hat!&rdquo; roared Dudd Flockley, the student who had
been thus assaulted. &ldquo;Who did this, I demand
to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knocked the ball&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t aim for your
hat,&rdquo; answered Tom. And as Dudd Flockley
held up the damaged hat he could not help but
grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did it on purpose, Tom Rover!&rdquo; growled
the dudish student. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t deny it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Dudd!&rdquo; put in Stanley. &ldquo;He
wanted to make a home run&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t aiming
at your hat at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know better!&rdquo; answered the other student,
bitterly. &ldquo;Say, Tom Rover, it&rsquo;s up to you to buy
me a new hat,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, if that&rsquo;s the way you feel about it,&rdquo;
answered Tom. &ldquo;You get the hat and I&rsquo;ll pay
for it. But I didn&rsquo;t smash it on purpose, Dudd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That hat cost me five dollars, and I don&rsquo;t
know where to get one like it,&rdquo; growled the
dudish pupil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can tell you where to get a hat like
that!&rdquo; piped in a drawling voice. &ldquo;Try the Melrose
English Shop, on Broadway. They have all
styles, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for William Philander Tubbs!&rdquo; cried
Dick. &ldquo;He knows the directory on straw hats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! Think I&rsquo;m going all the way to New
York for a new hat?&rdquo; growled Dudd Flockley.
&ldquo;I want one to go home in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can lend you an old one,&rdquo; suggested
Tom, dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your old hat,&rdquo; growled Dudd
Flockley. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a new one&mdash;and you can foot
the bill!&rdquo; and he turned and walked away, his
face full of sourness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same old Flockley,&rdquo; whispered Sam to
his brother. &ldquo;After all we did for him, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You beware of Dudd,&rdquo; put in Songbird, who
was near. &ldquo;He pretends to be friendly, since
you put in a good word for him to the doctor, but,
just the same, he has got it in for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; called out the umpire; and then
the ball was thrown down to Frank Holden, and
the game went on. Tom gave one more glance
in the direction of Dudd Flockley and saw that
the dudish student had stopped in his walk, turned
around, and was glaring at him savagely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>To my old readers the lads who have thus far
taken a part in this story will need no special
introduction. But for the benefit of others who
have not read the former volumes in this &ldquo;Rover
Boys Series,&rdquo; let me state that Dick, Tom and
Sam Rover were three brothers, who, when at
home, lived with their father, Anderson Rover,
and their Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha, on
a beautiful farm called Valley Brook.</p>
<p>From the farm, and while their father was in
Africa, the three boys had been sent to a military
academy, as related in the first volume of this
series, called &ldquo;The Rover Boys at School.&rdquo; At
the school they made a large number of friends,
and also a few enemies, and had &ldquo;the best time
ever,&rdquo; as Sam expressed it.</p>
<p>A term at school was followed by a trip on the
ocean, as set down in the second volume of this
series, and then by a journey to Africa, where
the boys went to locate their father, who had become
a captive of the natives. After that came
a trip out West, to locate a mine belonging to
the Rovers, and then trips to the Great Lakes,
and to the mountains, and then, returning to the
school, the lads went into camp with the other
cadets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we had better settle down now,&rdquo; said
Dick. But this was not to be. Not much later
they took a long trip on land and sea, and followed
this up by a voyage on the Ohio and the
Mississippi Rivers on a flatboat. Then came some
thrilling adventures on the plains, and a little
later found the dauntless boys in Southern
waters, where they solved the mystery of a deserted
steam yacht.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The farm for mine!&rdquo; said Tom, after traveling
north from the Gulf, and all of the boys were
glad to take it easy for some weeks, and also get
ready to graduate from Putnam Hall. They
had an idea they were to go directly from the military
school to college. But something turned up
which made them change their plans.</p>
<p>Through Mr. Rover it was learned that a small
fortune belonging to a certain Stanhope estate
was missing. It had been secreted on an island
of the West Indies, and it was settled that the
Rovers and some of their friends should go in
quest of it.</p>
<p>The boys were particularly anxious to locate
this treasure, and with good reason. While at
Putnam Hall they had made the acquaintance of
Dora Stanhope and also of Nellie and Grace Laning,
Dora&rsquo;s cousins. From the very start Dick was
attracted to Dora, and now the pair were practically
engaged to be married. Tom had taken a
particular liking to Nellie Laning and it must be
confessed that Sam was equally smitten with
Grace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>It was learned that the treasure had been
willed to Mr. Stanhope, and consequently, on his
death, it had become part of his estate, which in
turn had been willed in part to his wife and Dora,
with a small share to Mrs. Laning, his sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get that treasure and make the girls
happy,&rdquo; declared Dick, and how the whole crowd
set off on the quest has already been told in the
thirteenth volume of this series, entitled: &ldquo;The
Rover Boys on Treasure Isle.&rdquo; The treasure was
also claimed by two of their enemies, Sid Merrick
and his nephew, Tad Sobber, and they did
all they could to gain possession of the valuables.
But the treasure was at last brought safely to
this country, and then it was learned that Sid
Merrick had been lost at sea in a hurricane. Tad
Sobber was saved, and carried on a passing vessel
to England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now for college!&rdquo; cried all of the Rover
boys, and wondered to what institution of learning
they were to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to go to Brill?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Rover. &ldquo;It is a fine place, located in one
of our middle-western states, and the head of it,
Doctor John Wallington, is an old friend of
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>The boys had heard that Dora, Grace and Nellie
were going to an institution known as Hope
Seminary, not far from the town of Ashton. As
soon as they learned that Brill College was situated
less than two miles from Hope they decided
without hesitation to go to the institution
their parent had mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be near the girls, and we ought to have
lots of good times,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be our own fault if we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Dick
had answered.</p>
<p>How the brothers went to Brill has already
been related in the volume entitled &ldquo;The Rover
Boys at College.&rdquo; At Brill, as at Putnam Hall,
they quickly made a number of friends, not the
least of whom were Stanley Browne, Max Spangler,
a German student, and Allen Charter, the
leading senior. They also had with them their
former school chums, John Powell, better known
as Songbird because of his cleverness in writing
and reciting doggerel, and William Philander
Tubbs, a student whose entire spare time was
spent in buying things to wear of the latest fashions,
and in seeking the society of his young lady
friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>At Brill the Rovers soon came into contact with
the dudish pupil, Dudd Flockley, and also with
two bullies, Jerry Koswell and Bart Larkspur.
Led by Koswell, who was a thoroughly bad egg,
the three tried their best to make trouble for the
Rovers, and finally succeeded. But the rascals
overreached themselves, and when they were exposed
Koswell and Larkspur became so frightened
that they ran away from Brill and refused
to return. Dudd Flockley remained, and he
pleaded so earnestly to be forgiven that the Rovers
finally decided to drop the case against him,
and spoke a good word for him to the head of
the college, and he was allowed to continue at
Brill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess Flockley has learned his lesson,&rdquo; said
Dick. But it looked as if he might be mistaken,
for Flockley, as soon as he felt himself secure at
Brill, acted in anything but a grateful manner.
Yet he was not as assertive as he had been, for
he missed the companionship and support of his
former cronies.</p>
<p>With the fortune in their possession, and Sid
Merrick dead, the Stanhopes and Lanings had
felt secure of their wealth. But, returning from
England, Tad Sobber had gone to a shyster lawyer,
and put in a claim, and the lawyer had obtained
a court injunction, restraining anybody
from touching a dollar of the money. This depressed
the girls greatly, and made them, for a
time, leave Hope. But in the end, the injunction
was dissolved, and the Stanhopes and Lanings
were told that they could do as they pleased with
the fortune.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best news yet!&rdquo; Dick had said, on
hearing it. &ldquo;I guess that will put a spoke in Tad
Sobber&rsquo;s wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will take one out, you mean,&rdquo; returned
Tom, with a sly grin. &ldquo;Wonder what Tad will
do next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; had come from Sam.
&ldquo;He is knocked out clean and clear. I always
said he had no right to the fortune. That claim
of Sid Merrick&rsquo;s was a fake pure and simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; Dick answered. &ldquo;Just the
same, I feel, somehow, that Tad won&rsquo;t give up
even yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can he do?&rdquo; his two brothers had
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;but he&rsquo;ll try to do something;
see if he doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few days later had come in some particulars
of the case. After the injunction had been dissolved
Tad Sobber and his lawyer had gotten into
a big row and Sobber had ended by blackening
the legal gentleman&rsquo;s left eye. Then Sobber had
mysteriously disappeared, but the next day he
had sent a rambling letter to Mrs. Stanhope, stating
that, even if thrown out of court, he considered
that the fortune from Treasure Isle belonged
to him, and, sooner or later, he meant to gain
possession of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to watch out for Tad Sobber,&rdquo;
had been Dick&rsquo;s comment, on learning the news.
&ldquo;He is growing desperate, and there is no telling
what he will do next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the same old sneak he was at Putnam
Hall,&rdquo; declared Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will scare Mrs. Stanhope, and Mrs. Laning,
too,&rdquo; had been Sam&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the girls,&rdquo; his oldest brother had added.
&ldquo;I wish we could round Tad Sobber up, and put
him where he couldn&rsquo;t worry them any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll drop out of sight,&rdquo; said Tom.
But this was not to be. Tad Sobber was to cause
a great deal of trouble, as we shall learn in the
near future. The young rascal had convinced
himself that the Stanhope fortune belonged to
him, and he meant to leave no stone unturned to
get possession of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">THE FIRE ON THE STEAMER</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cry came as Tom knocked a neat liner out
to center field. He managed to get to first base
with ease, while Dick, on the alert, slid to the
home plate just before the ball came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That gives us five runs, anyway!&rdquo; was Stanley&rsquo;s
comment. &ldquo;Now, Spud, see what you can
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is where I knock one across the river
and back,&rdquo; declared Spud Jackson, as he came
forward with a bat. &ldquo;Better chase your men
away out,&rdquo; he added to Frank Holden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can use nets,&rdquo; answered the pitcher with
a grin.</p>
<p>Spud had a ball and a strike called on him and
then met the leather and sent it to the shortstop.
Tom had to run for second and he legged it with
might and main. But the ball got there ahead of
him and he was put out, and so was the runner
at first.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; cried Songbird. &ldquo;Thought you were
going to knock the ball across the river and back,
Spud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did,&rdquo; answered Spud, as he walked up
from first. &ldquo;It landed on the other side, bounced
back, and the shortstop got it. Fierce luck, eh?&rdquo;
And he cut a face that made many of the students
standing by laugh outright.</p>
<p>In the next inning the other side added two
runs to their total. One of these runs was made
by Sam, much to the youngest Rover&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got you going!&rdquo; he cried, to his brothers
and the others. &ldquo;Might as well give up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! we haven&rsquo;t started yet,&rdquo; retorted Tom.
He turned to William Philander Tubbs, who had
strolled near. &ldquo;Say, Tubby, old boy, lend me
your green socks for luck, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom, please don&rsquo;t ask me to&mdash;ah&mdash;lend
those socks,&rdquo; pleaded William Philander, innocently.
&ldquo;They are the only pair of that shade I
have, and the young ladies say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t resist you when you have them
on,&rdquo; finished Tom. &ldquo;All right, if you want me to
lose the game, keep the socks,&rdquo; and the fun-loving
Rover put on a mournful look.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear Tom, how can my socks have
anything to do with the game?&rdquo; questioned the
dude, helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a psychological phenomena, Tublets.
Sort of an inter-mental telepathy, so to speak&mdash;a
rhomboid compendium indexus, as it were. Of
course you understand,&rdquo; said Tom, soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;ah&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I do, Tom,&rdquo; stammered
the dude. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t loan the socks,
really I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; And he backed away with all possible
haste, while some of the students poked each
other in the ribs and some laughed outright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, here is where we go at &rsquo;em, hammer
and tongs!&rdquo; cried Dick, as he walked to the
plate. And he met the first ball pitched and lined
a beautiful three-bagger to deep center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! That&rsquo;s the way to do it!&rdquo; yelled
Tom. &ldquo;Leg it, old man, leg it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve struck our gait!&rdquo; sang out another
player. &ldquo;Now, Tom, you&rsquo;ve got to bring him
home sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom was on the alert and after one strike managed
to send the ball down into left field. Dick
came home and the batter got to second, although
it was a tight squeeze.</p>
<p>Spud was up next, and this time his face wore
a &ldquo;do-or-die&rdquo; look. He had two balls called on
him, and then whack! his bat struck the ball and
the horsehide went sailing far over the right
fielder&rsquo;s head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s a beaut!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on in, Tom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it a two-bagger, Spud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can get to third if you try!&rdquo; yelled Dick,
and Spud did try and landed in a cloud of dust
on third base just a second before the ball got
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, Wilson, bring Spud in,&rdquo; said
Dick, to the next fellow at the bat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it a homer and bring yourself in too,
Wilson,&rdquo; added Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By chimminy! Make him two home runs
while you are at it alretty!&rdquo; cried Max Spangler,
with a broad smile. Since arriving at Brill the
German American lad had become quite a baseball
&ldquo;fan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, there, you fellows!&rdquo; came unexpectedly
from the center fielder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; yelled back Frank Holden,
stepping out of the pitcher&rsquo;s box and turning
around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something is wrong on the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong on the river?&rdquo; queried several, in a
chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Don&rsquo;t you hear the screaming?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Time!&rdquo; cried the umpire, and the game came
to a stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that <i>is</i> somebody screaming!&rdquo; exclaimed
Stanley. &ldquo;Sounds like a girl&rsquo;s voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from that excursion boat!&rdquo; said another
student. And as he spoke he pointed to a small
river steamer, gaily decorated with flags and
bunting, that had appeared around a bend of the
stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s the <i>Thistle</i>!&rdquo; ejaculated Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Thistle</i>?&rdquo; repeated Sam. &ldquo;Oh, Dick,
that&rsquo;s the steamer the girls from Hope were
going to use for their picnic up the river!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose Grace and Nellie and Dora
are on board?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are yelling like Indians!&rdquo; cried the center
fielder. &ldquo;Come on, something is wrong,
sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the instant the game of baseball was forgotten,
and like a drove of wild horses the college
boys raced down to the edge of the river,
which at this point was over a quarter of a mile
wide but quite shallow. As they did this they
heard the steam whistle of the <i>Thistle</i> sound out
loud and long.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a call for assistance, that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo;
said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope the girls are safe!&rdquo; murmured his
youngest brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s on fire, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter!&rdquo; exclaimed
Tom. &ldquo;See the smoke coming from the
cabin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire! fire! fire!&rdquo; was the cry taken up on all
sides. &ldquo;The steamer is on fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they run to the dock?&rdquo; asked one
of the students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t deep enough,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;They are going to dredge out the channel this
summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are turning towards shore!&rdquo; came, a
second later, and then it could be seen that the
<i>Thistle</i> had turned partly around. But the next
instant the vessel ran into a mud shoal and there
she stuck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let us get out and help those who
are on board!&rdquo; cried Dick, and started on a run
for the college boathouse, located two hundred
yards further up the shore.</p>
<p>The alarm was now general, and fully two
score of students and several of the faculty, as
well as some workmen, were running for the
boathouse, to get out the rowboats and other
craft usually housed there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stanley, how about your gasolene launch?&rdquo;
questioned Dick, as they raced along the river
bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s all ready to use,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I
had her out a little while early this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go out with you in that, if you say
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; was the ready response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want us?&rdquo; queried Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Sam better bring another boat,&rdquo;
answered Dick. &ldquo;The more the better. The
<i>Thistle</i> must have quite a crowd on board&mdash;if all
the Hope students went on that picnic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grace said about thirty girls were going,&rdquo; replied
Sam. &ldquo;Oh, if they get burned&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t wait for that&mdash;they&rsquo;ll jump into
the river first,&rdquo; answered Tom soberly. For the
time being all the fun was knocked out of him.</p>
<p>While talking, the boys had been busy with
the boats. Stanley&rsquo;s gasolene launch was pushed
out, and he and Dick leaped aboard, and the latter
set the flywheel going. The engine was in
good running order, and soon a steady put-put!
sounded out, and the craft headed for the burning
steamer. But, as quick as Dick and Stanley
were in their movements, Tom and Sam were
equally alert, and as the launch moved away Tom
and his brother scrambled into a rowboat, oars in
hand, and caught fast to the power craft with a
boathook.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can pull us as well as not,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; answered Stanley. &ldquo;And
the quicker both boats get to that steamer the
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they drew closer to the <i>Thistle</i> they saw a
volume of smoke roll up from the engine room.
A barrel of oil had taken fire and the crew had
found it impossible to subdue the conflagration.
As yet the fire was only a small one, but there
was no telling how soon it would spread, and the
seminary girls on board were panic-stricken,
more especially as the teacher who chanced to
be with them was herself an extremely nervous
person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, girls, what shall we do?&rdquo; asked Grace
Laning, after the first dreadful alarm was at an
end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we had better jump overboard,&rdquo; suggested
Nellie Laning. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be burned
alive!&rdquo; And her wide-open eyes showed her terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jump yet,&rdquo; said Dora Stanhope, as
bravely as she could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, girls, we&rsquo;ll be burned to death! I know
it, I feel it!&rdquo; wailed another seminary student.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are near Brill College,&rdquo; said another.
&ldquo;Let us cry for help!&rdquo; And then commenced
the screaming that reached the players on the ball
field and others near the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the captain of the steamer,
aided by his men, was doing all in his power to
subdue the flames. But oil when on fire is a
hard thing to fight. The blaze was close to the
engine room, and presently both the engineer
and the firemen were driven from their posts.
Then the steamer became unmanageable and
drifted on the mud shoal, as already mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get out the small boats,&rdquo; cried
the captain. But even as he spoke he knew that
the small boats were of no avail, for they had
not been used since the <i>Thistle</i> had been put into
commission, three years before, and they were
dried out, and would fill with water as soon as
unshipped. Life preservers were to be had, and a
few of the girls were thoughtful enough to supply
themselves with these.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crowd her, Stanley!&rdquo; cried Dick, as the
launch headed straight for the burning steamer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give her all she will stand,&rdquo; responded the
owner of the launch, and he turned the lever
down another notch. The revolutions of the flywheel
increased, and the water was churned up
in a white foam at the stern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, back there, that you aren&rsquo;t
swamped!&rdquo; yelled Stanley to Tom and Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look out!&rdquo; was Sam&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;Only
hurry up, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the launch and the rowboat it was towing
neared the burning steamer the college students
gazed eagerly at the forms on the forward deck
of the <i>Thistle</i>. Nearly all of the seminary girls
were still screaming, and some were waving their
arms wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! help! help!&rdquo; was the cry wafted over
the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are coming!&rdquo; yelled Dick. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jump
overboard unless you are good swimmers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick! Dick!&rdquo; screamed Dora. &ldquo;Oh, Dick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dora!&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom!&rdquo; came from Nellie. &ldquo;Please take
us off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam, you are just in time!&rdquo; added Grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get you off&mdash;don&rsquo;t worry!&rdquo; cried
Dick. &ldquo;Just wait till we can bring the boats
alongside and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a mad yell from one of
the men on the steamer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up and leave!&rdquo; yelled the man in terror.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get at the boilers no more and
I guess she is going to blow up!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">COLLEGE BOYS TO THE RESCUE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dick! do you think the steamer will
really blow up?&rdquo; gasped Sam, as the two small
boats ranged up beside the larger vessel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;if they can&rsquo;t get at the boilers to let
off steam,&rdquo; was Dick&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;But they ought
to have safety valves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the man is so excited he doesn&rsquo;t know
what he is talking about,&rdquo; put in Tom.</p>
<p>Fortunately the <i>Thistle</i> was not a high boat,
but broad and shallow, so the rail of the vessel
was but a few feet above that of the launch and
the rowboat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Dora, and Nellie and Grace!&rdquo; called
out Dick. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll help you down.&rdquo; He turned
to Stanley. &ldquo;Can you hold her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! But what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climb up to the rail and help them down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do the same!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Steady the
rowboat, Sam!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>In a few seconds Dick and Tom were at the
rail of the <i>Thistle</i>. All of the girls who had been
out for a picnic were in a bunch, and many of
them were still screaming for help. But Dora
and the Laning girls were now quiet, realizing
that aid was close at hand. Another gasolene
launch was coming up, dragging behind it nearly
every rowboat Brill possessed.</p>
<p>It did not take Dick long to assist Dora over
the rail and into the launch, and Nellie and
Grace and several other girls followed. In the
meantime Sam rescued a teacher and two girls.
By this time the other launch was at hand, with
the additional rowboats, and in a very few minutes
all of the passengers of the <i>Thistle</i> had been
transferred. In the excitement one of the college
boys and one of the seminary girls fell overboard,
but the other Brill lads promptly came to the
rescue.</p>
<div class="img">

<p class="center"><span class="small">IT DID NOT TAKE DICK LONG TO ASSIST DORA INTO THE LAUNCH.</span></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us land the girls on the shore and then
try to save the steamer,&rdquo; suggested Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; cried Stanley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful&mdash;if she is ready to blow up!&rdquo;
warned Spud. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be blown into
the middle of next year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t blow up!&rdquo; cried the captain, who
was still trying to direct his men as to what to
do. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear the steam going off?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll do what we can for you,&rdquo; answered
several of the college youths.</p>
<p>One after another the small boats landed on the
shore, which was but a hundred yards away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam, you stay with the girls,&rdquo; said Dick to
his youngest brother. &ldquo;They may want you to do
something for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dick, don&rsquo;t get into trouble!&rdquo; begged
Dora, and bent her tender eyes full upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Dora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Tom, you be careful, too,&rdquo; added Nellie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Nellie,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>Both of the gasolene launches, with eight of
the college boys on board, returned to the <i>Thistle</i>.
The thick smoke of the burning oil was still
rolling up the companionways and hatchways.
But, with the deck cleared of passengers, the
crew had a better chance to fight the flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain, what can we do?&rdquo; demanded Dick,
as he climbed on deck, followed by Stanley and
by Allen Charter, who owned the second launch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered the master of the
vessel, almost helplessly. &ldquo;That oil burns like
fury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t sand be good for the flames?&rdquo;
questioned Allen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but I ain&rsquo;t got none&mdash;that is, not more&rsquo;n
a shovelful or two.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is sand up at the boat dock!&rdquo; cried
Stanley. &ldquo;They are going to use it for the new
garage foundation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can haul the steamer up there,&rdquo;
suggested another student.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can try it,&rdquo; answered Allen Charter.
&ldquo;What do you say, Captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing&mdash;if you can budge her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t be stuck very fast,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>The college boys got into the two launches
once more, and as speedily as possible ropes were
fastened to the <i>Thistle</i>. Then the launches were
started up and all power was turned on. At first
the big vessel refused to budge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem to be making any headway,&rdquo; observed
Frank Holden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we go!&rdquo; cried Dick, and he was right.
Slowly the <i>Thistle</i> moved off the mud shoal and
commenced to turn. Then as slowly the vessel
followed the two launches in the direction of the
dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want sand!&rdquo; yelled some of the boys on
board. &ldquo;Get the sand ready!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cries were understood, and by the time the
<i>Thistle</i> was brought close to the dock, fully a
score of boys stood ready with boxes and pails
of sand to come on board. A gangplank was
thrown out, and on deck hurried the sand carriers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; cried the captain, and his
face brightened with hope. &ldquo;Just give that sand
to me and the engineer. We know where to put
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boxes and pails were passed over with great
rapidity, and the sand was taken below and
thrown on the burning oil. It was hard and dangerous
work and some of the men were all but
overcome. While the work was going on Doctor
Wallington arrived, followed by the college
janitor and some others, all carrying fire extinguishers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, use these!&rdquo; cried the master of the institution,
and the fire extinguishers were soon
brought into play. Dick got one and Tom another
and with them succeeded in putting out
the flames that had reached one end of the cabin.</p>
<p>All of the men and the boys worked like Trojans,
and before long it could be seen that they
were getting the best of the conflagration. The
smoke was growing thinner and only an occasional
spurt of flames showed itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! we&rsquo;ll have it out soon!&rdquo; cried Tom,
enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;ll be mighty glad of it,&rdquo; muttered
the captain of the vessel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you are insured, Captain,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am&mdash;but a fire is always a loss, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys and the men continued their labors,
and inside of half an hour the fire was under control.
Some of the men went below to make an
examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mostly around the boilers,&rdquo; said the engineer.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great mess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hands of the <i>Thistle</i> continued to labor
and in a short while the last spark of fire was put
out. Then a tug was telephoned for to tow the
vessel down the river to the town.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Dick and Tom rejoined their
brother and the girls. The students from Hope,
with their teacher, had been invited to make
themselves at home in the reception rooms of the
college, and word of the disaster to the <i>Thistle</i>
had been telephoned to the seminary. Word was
also sent to the town, and a large number of persons
came out to learn the extent of the disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The newspapers will make a spread of this,&rdquo;
was Tom&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better send word
home that everybody is safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do!&rdquo; cried Nellie. &ldquo;Mamma will be so
worried when she hears about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we must send word at once,&rdquo; added
Dora. &ldquo;Mamma can&rsquo;t stand any excitement. She
has had more than enough lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean because of this affair about the fortune,
I suppose,&rdquo; returned Dick. &ldquo;It was an outrage
for Tad Sobber to hold up the money the
way he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dick, but that is not all,&rdquo; answered
Dora. &ldquo;I was going to tell you of something else
the first chance I got.&rdquo; She looked around, to see
if anybody else was listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what, Dora?&rdquo; he questioned, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About old Josiah Crabtree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crabtree!&rdquo; exclaimed the eldest Rover boy in
astonishment. &ldquo;What about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The person mentioned will be well remembered
by my old readers. Josiah Crabtree had once been
a teacher at Putnam Hall and had caused the
Rover boys a good deal of trouble. When Crabtree
had discovered that the widow Stanhope was
holding some money in trust for Dora, and also
had quite some money of her own, he had done
his best to get the widow to marry him. At that
time Mrs. Stanhope had been sickly and easily
led, and Crabtree had exercised a sort of hypnotic
influence over her and all but forced her into
a marriage. But his plot had been thwarted by
the Rovers, and later on, Josiah Crabtree had
been caught doing something that was against the
law and had been sent to prison for it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He has been bothering mamma again,&rdquo; went
on Dora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been bothering your mother! How can that
be, since he is in prison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is out again. It seems that while he was
in prison he acted so well that some folks took
pity on him and got up a petition to have him
pardoned. Now he is out, and almost the first
thing he did was to call on mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he have to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, exactly. But I do know that
mamma was greatly frightened, almost as much
so as when Tad Sobber called and said he was
going to get the fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did your mother think that Crabtree had reformed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t sure about that. What scared her
was the fact that he called at all. She expected
never to see him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t she order him to keep away? That
is what she ought to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it. But you know how mamma is,
rather weak and not wanting to make trouble for
anybody. She said she wished he wouldn&rsquo;t call
again, and she was greatly upset.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s a good thing you are going home
soon, Dora. You&rsquo;ll have to stay with her this
summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we and the Lanings are going to stay
altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we were going off on another trip together,
Dora,&rdquo; said Dick, in a lower voice.
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t our trip to Treasure Isle great?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly lovely&mdash;in spite of the troubles we
had,&rdquo; answered the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of a trip I am going to take
again&mdash;when we go off on our honeymoon,
Dora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dick!&rdquo; And Dora flushed prettily.
&ldquo;How can you say such things, and in a crowd!
Somebody may hear you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I only want you to know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began
Dick, but just then Tom and Sam brushed up
with Nellie and Grace, so the sentence was not
finished. Dora gave him a meaning look and he
held her arm considerably tighter than was necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the picnic is off, and they are going to
tow the steamer back,&rdquo; explained Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the young ladies are to be taken back
to the seminary in the college carryall and carriages,&rdquo;
added Sam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a shame!&rdquo; murmured Tom innocently.
&ldquo;Now they are here I thought they&rsquo;d stay till we
went home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Rover! what an idea!&rdquo; shrieked Nellie.
&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ve got to go back for our last examination,
and to pack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, we are to go East on the same
train,&rdquo; warned Dick. &ldquo;Let me know just when
you can start and I&rsquo;ll arrange for the tickets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are to leave Hope on Wednesday,&rdquo; said
Grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will suit us,&rdquo; answered Tom. &ldquo;We
might leave Tuesday afternoon, but it won&rsquo;t hurt
to stay here one night more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will give us time to rest up from the last
day&rsquo;s fun,&rdquo; added Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you expect any fun on the last day?&rdquo; questioned
Dora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we?&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Just you wait and see,
that&rsquo;s all! We&rsquo;ll turn old Brill inside out and upside
down!&rdquo; he added, with emphasis.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">WHAT FLOCKLEY HAD TO TELL</span></h2>
<p>It was not long before the carryall of the college
and several carriages were brought into use
and in these the girls and their teacher were
placed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see you Sunday!&rdquo; called out Dick to
Dora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we might as well go to church together,&rdquo;
added Sam; and so it was arranged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But about those messages home?&rdquo; asked Nellie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll send &rsquo;em&mdash;don&rsquo;t you worry,&rdquo; answered
Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go right down to Ashton now&mdash;on
our bicycles.&rdquo; And then the turnouts rolled away,
and the students of Brill were left once more to
themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, those girls can be thankful that the fire
was no worse,&rdquo; was Stanley&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon they are thankful,&rdquo; answered Dick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They were mighty glad we came up with the
boats,&rdquo; said another student. &ldquo;Some of them
thanked us over and over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! I don&rsquo;t think the boats were needed,&rdquo;
muttered Dudd Flockley. &ldquo;The water isn&rsquo;t over
two feet deep. They could have waded ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water is four to six feet deep and the
bottom out there is soft mud!&rdquo; cried Tom,
&ldquo;They&rsquo;d either have to swim or run the risk of
getting stuck in the mud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dudd is sore&mdash;because his hat was
mashed,&rdquo; cried another pupil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sore because none of the girls thanked
him,&rdquo; added another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he wasn&rsquo;t thanked because he didn&rsquo;t do
anything,&rdquo; said Spud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw! give us a rest!&rdquo; muttered Flockley, and
then walked away without another word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, did anybody notice William Philander
Tubbs?&rdquo; queried Will Faley. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t do much
towards rescuing the girls, but when they got
ashore he ran all the way to the college to get a
whisk broom, to brush them off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Washtub! He&rsquo;s the real hero!&rdquo;
cried Tom. &ldquo;He thinks of the truly important
things!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was a grand spectacle&mdash;the thick black
smoke pouring from that steamer,&rdquo; came from
Songbird. &ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I helped to get the sand. But
even as I worked I couldn&rsquo;t help but make up a
few lines. They run like this:&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;All wrapt in flames, behold our craft!</p>
<p class="t2">She&rsquo;ll plough the main no more!</p>
<p class="t0">Her gallant crew may well shed tears&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s burnt out to the core!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>finished Tom. &ldquo;Only that isn&rsquo;t true, for the
<i>Thistle</i> wasn&rsquo;t burnt to the core&mdash;in fact, the captain
says she was burnt very little&mdash;thanks to the
unswerving devotion of the gallant band of Brill
fire-fighters who, undaunted by the terrifying
perils of the horrible occasion succeeded, after almost
superhuman endeavors, in quelling&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great hambones! Tom&rsquo;s sprung a leak!&rdquo; interrupted
Sam. &ldquo;Tom, put on your low speed,
or you&rsquo;ll run away with yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, wretch! to interrupt such a superb flow
of oratory!&rdquo; cried the fun-loving Rover, in assumed
grieved tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if you didn&rsquo;t interrupt my poetry,&rdquo; came
ruefully from Songbird. &ldquo;The next time I&mdash;er&mdash;recite
I&rsquo;ll see to it that you are not around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it, Birdie, I beg of you. I wouldn&rsquo;t
miss your verses for a quart of freckles.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ashton&mdash;and the telegraph office!&rdquo; sang out
Dick. &ldquo;Who is going along?&rdquo; And the touch of
hard feelings between Tom and Songbird was
forgotten. Tom knew he had no right to interrupt
the would-be poet the way he did, but&mdash;well,
Tom was Tom, and he couldn&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>The matter was talked over, and a party of
nine was made up, including the Rovers and Songbird
and Stanley. Soon the lads were on the way,
having received permission from Doctor Wallington
to be a little late for supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll return home by the Carlip Road,&rdquo; said
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; added Tom. He knew this
would please Songbird, for the route mentioned
would take them past the Sanderson farm, and
the would-be poet would have a chance to see
Minnie, the farmer&rsquo;s daughter, with whom Songbird
had of late been quite smitten.</p>
<p>The messages for the Lanings and Mrs. Stanhope
were soon despatched, and the Rovers also
sent word to their folks, saying when they might
be expected home. Then the crowd divided, and
Tom, Dick, Sam and Songbird took to the road
leading past the Sanderson cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember how we pitched into Flockley and
Koswell here?&rdquo; remarked Sam, as the farm came
into view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do,&rdquo; answered Dick. He turned to
Songbird. &ldquo;You can ride ahead if you wish.
We&rsquo;ll go on slowly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered the other. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be
long. I only want to leave a volume of &lsquo;Poems of
Love&rsquo; I picked up in a bookstore yesterday,&rdquo; and
away Songbird pedaled towards the Sanderson
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got &rsquo;em sure,&rdquo; said Sam, with a grin.
&ldquo;Well, Minnie is a nice girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! I suppose Songbird has as much right
to be soft on her as you have to be soft on Grace!&rdquo;
was Tom&rsquo;s blunt comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to mention you and Nellie,&rdquo; retorted his
younger brother.</p>
<p>The three Rovers rode past the house and then
stopped to rest under a wide-spreading tree. Some
June apples were handy, and they munched on
these until Songbird reappeared, about a quarter
of an hour later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, it took more than two minutes to deliver
that book,&rdquo; remarked Dick. &ldquo;We were just getting
ready to go on without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget we want some supper,&rdquo; added
Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I just stopped to point out several
poems of special interest,&rdquo; explained Songbird.
&ldquo;One was on &lsquo;Her Eyes So Blue and True.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s
a grand poem, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see, Miss Sanderson&rsquo;s eyes are blue,
aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; questioned Sam, gravely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t speaking of her eyes&mdash;I meant the
poem&rsquo;s&mdash;that is&mdash;those spoken of in the poem,&rdquo;
stammered Songbird. &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he added,
hastily, to hide his confusion, &ldquo;I just heard
strange news. Minnie and her father were down
in Ashton a couple of days ago and they saw
Dudd Flockley at the depot, and he was talking
with Jerry Koswell and Bart Larkspur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Koswell and Larkspur!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t think they would dare to show themselves
around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I thought, but Mr. Sanderson and
Minnie were both sure they saw the pair. They
were talking very earnestly to Flockley, as if trying
to get him to do something, and Minnie says
Flockley said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see about it&mdash;maybe I can
go.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Flockley promised that he would
drop Koswell and Larkspur,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d better&mdash;if he knows where he is well
off,&rdquo; added Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of Koswell and Larkspur?&rdquo;
questioned Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Minnie says they took the night train for the
East.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The through train?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then they must be a good many miles
from Ashton&mdash;and I am glad of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of Flockley puts me in mind of one
thing&mdash;I mustn&rsquo;t forget to pay for that hat I
smashed,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better see him tonight and settle up,&rdquo; said
Dick. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll go with you. I want to speak to
Flockley,&rdquo; he added, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>When the boys returned to the college they
found their classmates just finishing supper. Professor
Blackie looked at them rather severely, but
Sam explained that they had permission from the
Head to be late, so nothing was said further.</p>
<p>From one of the other students Dick and Sam
learned that Flockley had gone for a walk behind
the gymnasium, where a path led to the river.
As soon as they had finished eating Tom got some
money, and he and his brother set off to find the
dudish student.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; cried Dick, after quite a long
walk, and he pointed to Dudd Flockley, seated on
a rustic bench, smoking a cigarette. The student
was alone, and looked to be in a thoughtful mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flockley, I want to settle with you for that
hat,&rdquo; said Tom, as he came up. &ldquo;And let me
tell you honestly that I am sorry I mashed it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think you did it on purpose,&rdquo; grumbled the
dudish student. &ldquo;You Rovers think you can do
just as you please at Brill. I suppose you&rsquo;ll feel
more important than ever&mdash;after that affair of the
burning steamer,&rdquo; he added, bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dudd, let Tom pay you for the hat and then
let me talk to you,&rdquo; said Dick, quietly. &ldquo;How
much did it cost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are then,&rdquo; came from Tom, and he
passed over a five-dollar bill. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mash it
on purpose, no matter what you think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;have your own way about it, Rover,&rdquo;
and Dudd pocketed the bill carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dudd, you met Koswell and Larkspur the
other day,&rdquo; went on Dick, sitting down on the
rustic bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Minnie Sanderson tell you that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told Songbird Powell and he told us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what of it? They came to Ashton on
business&mdash;they had to get their stuff away from
the college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you meet them by accident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What business is that of yours?&rdquo; And Dudd
Flockley&rsquo;s voice grew aggressive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is none of my business, Dudd. But,
just the same, I am going to talk to you about it.
You know all about what happened in the past.
Koswell and Larkspur are bad eggs&mdash;and if they
can drag you down with them they will do it.
Now, you promised to turn over a new leaf and
on the strength of that we went to Doctor Wallington
and persuaded him to give you another
chance. It isn&rsquo;t fair for you to go back on your
word, and take up with Koswell and Larkspur
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to tell the doctor that I met
them?&rdquo; asked Flockley, in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;at least, not for the present. But I want
you to promise to drop that pair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have dropped them&mdash;that is, as much as I
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you meet them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you why!&rdquo; burst out the dudish student,
bitterly. &ldquo;Because I can&rsquo;t drop them altogether.
They know everything of what happened
as well as I do, and they said if I dropped them
entirely&mdash;refused to help them&mdash;they would expose
me to the whole world! If they should tell
my folks&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Flockley did not finish, but his
head sunk on his breast, and Dick and Tom understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad&mdash;a burning shame!&rdquo; murmured
Tom. &ldquo;Flockley, I am sorry from the bottom
of my heart!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I would take their threats too
seriously,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;They are down and out,
and, of course, very bitter. But they don&rsquo;t dare
to come out against you openly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but they can do a whole lot of things
behind my back!&rdquo; groaned Dudd Flockley. &ldquo;Oh,
you don&rsquo;t know what I have suffered since Jerry
and Bart ran away! They have written me letters,
and they have demanded money&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demanded money. Then they are blackmailers,
Dudd!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they said I owed them the money on bets.
But I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;at least, I don&rsquo;t think I did. But
I had to give up. At the depot that day I gave
them thirty dollars&mdash;all I could scrape up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did they go to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To New York, and from there they are going
to Boston and then to some place off the coast of
Maine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they wanted you to join them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it!&rdquo; cried Dick, earnestly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it, Dudd! Wash your hands
of them and refuse to have anything more to do
with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will&mdash;if I can,&rdquo; murmured Dudd Flockley.
And then, as some other students approached, the
talk had to come to an end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">A CELEBRATION ON THE CAMPUS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Tom, this is great!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now, Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of us have passed the exams with credit
marks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of us? Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was in the classroom not five minutes
ago and got the good word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that makes me feel like dancing a jig!&rdquo;
cried Tom Rover, and he did a few steps on the
floor of the gymnasium. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the folks at
home be tickled when they hear of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick got the highest marks of the class,&rdquo; went
on the youngest Rover. &ldquo;Stanley is next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do we come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are seventh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, lucky seventh!&rdquo; murmured the fun-loving
Rover. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always that way! At baseball
if I do anything at all it is usually in the seventh
innings.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t grow superstitious, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stand fifth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s splendid, Sam! Oh, come on and jig!&rdquo;
And Tom caught his brother by the waist and
whirled him around. Over the gymnasium floor
they went, to land suddenly into the form of William
Philander Tubbs, who had just entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say, don&rsquo;t you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; spluttered
William Philander. He had the breath all but
knocked out of his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Tublets,&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me Tublets, please,&rdquo; expostulated
the tall student. &ldquo;And please don&rsquo;t run into me
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sam and I were only doing a war dance,&rdquo;
cried Tom, gaily. &ldquo;We have passed our exams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very rude, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shan&rsquo;t occur again, Philliam Willander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;William Philander, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, I am glad I am sorry that I remember
I forgot,&rdquo; answered Tom, gravely. &ldquo;It
shan&rsquo;t occur again the last time, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom, let up!&rdquo; put in Dick, who had come
up. &ldquo;We have passed&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t that make you
feel good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you at the head of the class, Dick! Say,
if I had wings, or an aeroplane, I&rsquo;d fly!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on for a last swing on the rings!&rdquo; exclaimed
Dick, and led the way, and soon all of
the brothers were exercising on the flying rings
with which the college gymnasium was equipped.</p>
<p>It was Monday afternoon and studies were
practically at an end and all the boys had to do
was to pack up their things and wait for the
time to go home.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning the three Rovers had
driven over to Hope Seminary and taken Dora
and the Lanings to church. At that time it had
been arranged that all should start for home on
the early morning train on the following Wednesday.
They would travel together as far as a
place called Cartown and then separate, the girls
to go on to Cedarville and the lads to journey to
Oak Run, the nearest railroad station to the farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the fellows are going home Tuesday
night,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;So if we are going to have
any fun we had better have it Monday night,&rdquo;
and so it was arranged.</p>
<p>The Rovers had had no further opportunity to
talk to Dudd Flockley. They noticed that Flockley
avoided them and seemed to be in deep
thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he is thinking of Koswell and Larkspur,&rdquo;
said Dick. &ldquo;Poor fellow, I feel sorry for
him! I hope he doesn&rsquo;t let them drag him down
any deeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has only himself to blame for the position
he is in,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;We did what we could for
him&mdash;more than most fellows would do, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Supper was had at the usual hour and then the
students commenced to gather on the campus and
down by the river. Nearly everybody was in
good humor, and they sang, and made a racket
generally. Bonfires were lit, and also a string of
paper lanterns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a surprise for the crowd,&rdquo; said Tom
to Sam. &ldquo;Come on and help me to wake Brill
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; questioned the younger Rover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon show you&mdash;come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom led the way to a storeroom behind the
gymnasium. In one corner, under some old canvas,
was a box several feet long, that had come
in by express.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the time of my life getting this here
without having it pass inspection by the Head,&rdquo;
said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in it, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fireworks&mdash;a regular Fourth of July outfit&mdash;rockets,
Roman candles, pinwheels, bombs, and
all. I sent the order to the city a week ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; cried Sam, with a grin. &ldquo;This
will certainly wake up the natives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See if you can get Dick to help us. But be
careful&mdash;I want to surprise all the rest, even Stanley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get him,&rdquo; answered Sam, and hurried off.</p>
<p>A little later, when it was quite dark, the
three Rover boys shouldered the big box and carried
it to the edge of the woods beside the campus.
Then they opened the box and took out the
fireworks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ll send up a few bombs first, just to
wake everybody up,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>A minute later a large-sized bomb went whistling
upward in the air. It flew high over the college
building, to burst with a deafening report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; yelled several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who fired that shot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did a cannon go off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an aerial bomb&mdash;and there goes another!&rdquo;
cried Allen Charter. &ldquo;Somebody is celebrating
in earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of the students on the campus stared at
the bombs in wonder, while others came rushing
from various buildings, to learn the meaning of
the reports.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who shot off the cannon?&rdquo; stormed Professor
Sharp. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s against the rules to shoot off that
cannon without permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t the cannon, Professor,&rdquo; explained
Frank Holden. &ldquo;It was a bomb. Somebody&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boom! went another bomb, and it was right
over the professor&rsquo;s head. The professor was
scared and ducked wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want the person who is doing that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he
commenced, but got no further, for just then a
big rocket went hissing through the air, to burst
a second later and let fall a beautiful shower of
golden rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t that grand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this is something like!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be that Doctor Wallington meant to surprise
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far into the sky flew two more rockets, one letting
fall some chains of red, white and blue and
the other some strange fish-like shapes that darted
hither and thither.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is certainly all to the merry!&rdquo; murmured
Stanley. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as good as a Fourth of July exhibition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the Roman candles!&rdquo; cried Max,
pointing over to the woods. From among the
trees three large Roman candles were sending
their balls of various colors high into the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is a surprise and no mistake,&rdquo; murmured
Doctor Wallington, as he gazed at the fireworks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know about them, Doctor?&rdquo; questioned
Allen Charter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It must be the work of some students.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see who is doing it!&rdquo; cried Stanley,
and ran for the woods, followed by a score of
others.</p>
<p>When the crowd arrived they found Dick, Tom
and Sam in the act of setting off more rockets and
Roman candles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you sure surprised us!&rdquo; cried Stanley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s out of sight!&rdquo; murmured Spud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! I am sorry,&rdquo; murmured Tom. &ldquo;I
thought it was very much in sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know what I mean, Tom. It&rsquo;s bang-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure is that!&rdquo; cried Sam, as one of the
rockets exploded with a loud report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are some packages of red lights,&rdquo; said
Tom. &ldquo;I want every fellow here to take one and
light it. Then we&rsquo;ll form a procession and march
around the buildings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; cried Stanley. &ldquo;Say, if we
only had a band!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and git my drum,&rdquo; cried Max, who
chanced to own one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll get my bugle,&rdquo; added a student who
possessed such an instrument.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>By the time the drum and bugle were brought
the red lights were lit, and amid a general cheering
the students got into line and the march
around the college buildings began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on in, Dudd!&rdquo; cried Dick, to Flockley,
who stood looking on, and he passed over a red
light which the student took rather unwillingly.
&ldquo;Everybody in this march!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Around and around the buildings marched the
students. William Philander Tubbs wanted to
keep out of the procession, but he was caught by
Sam and Tom and made to carry a flag consisting
of an old red sweater tied to the handle of a
broom. Other boys carried the college colors, and
they added to the din with tin horns and wooden
rattles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My! but this is disgraceful!&rdquo; muttered Professor
Sharp, in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disgraceful?&rdquo; cried Doctor Wallington. &ldquo;Not
at all, sir. Let the young men enjoy themselves.
They are doing no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like so much noise,&rdquo; snapped Asa
Sharp, and retired to the college building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got about a dozen packs of firecrackers,&rdquo;
said Tom, a little later. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t forget to
shoot them off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass &rsquo;em around, Tom!&rdquo; cried Stanley, and
the firecrackers were quickly distributed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on and give old Filbury a scare,&rdquo; suggested
Spud, and before anybody could stop him
he went off after the old man who worked around
the dormitories. He found Filbury on a step-ladder,
fixing a lamp, and he very quietly pinned
his firecrackers to the old man&rsquo;s coat tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want, sir?&rdquo; asked the old man,
as he started to come down the step-ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to ask you if you knew where my
baseball was,&rdquo; asked Spud, innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know nuthing about baseballs,&rdquo;
growled Filbury. He sniffed the air. &ldquo;Say,
smells like something burning around here!&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;Did any of them fireworks set fire to
the buildings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; answered Spud. &ldquo;But about that
ball&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crack! bang! crack! went a number of the firecrackers
and poor Filbury leaped several feet into
the air. Then he turned hastily around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he demanded, and then
a long string of the firecrackers went off, causing
him to whirl first to one side and then another.
He put his hands behind him. &ldquo;Ouch! I&rsquo;m burnt!&rdquo;
he screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoopla! that&rsquo;s the way to celebrate!&rdquo; roared
Spud. &ldquo;Nothing like having fun while you are
at it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;fun&rsquo; you!&rdquo; yelled Filbury, in anger, and
of a sudden he drew off his coat and commenced
to chase Spud. Down the corridor went the pair.
And then Filbury cast the coat with the firecrackers
still exploding, at Spud&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Spud ducked and the coat sailed over his head,
to enter a doorway that was partly open. Then
another person appeared. It was Professor Asa
Sharp. He stepped on the coat and as he did so
several of the firecrackers went off, one hitting
him directly in the chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;I am hit! Take those
fireworks away!&rdquo; And he bolted down the hallway
with all the speed he could command. He
ran out on a porch and then down on the campus,
where Tom and Sam were bending over something
on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out! Run!&rdquo; yelled Tom, and then he
and his brother leaped back. In bewilderment
Professor Asa Sharp stood still. Then a terrific
explosion rent the air, and a great shower of
sparks flew in all directions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">GOOD-BYE TO BRILL</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that was an explosion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was that stood so close?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These and a number of other cries and questions
came from the students of Brill who had
witnessed the setting off, by Tom and Sam, of the
last of the fireworks.</p>
<p>As for the two Rover boys, they knew not what
to say. Both stared helplessly for a moment at
Professor Sharp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! hi!&rdquo; spluttered that individual. &ldquo;Stop it!
Do you want to blow me to pieces? Oh, I&rsquo;m all
on fire!&rdquo; And, seeing that his coat had ignited
from some of the sparks, he commenced to dance
around in terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;wait, Professor!&rdquo; called out Tom. &ldquo;Let
me knock out that fire!&rdquo; And he began to beat
out the flames with his hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t hit me so hard, Rover!&rdquo; snarled
the professor, for in his excitement Tom was
pounding away harder than intended. Sam also
came forward to put out the sparks, and so did
Dick and some others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, give me that broom, Tubbs!&rdquo; cried the
eldest Rover, and catching the article, Dick whipped
off the red sweater and then used the broom to
sweep from Asa Sharp what was left of the fire.</p>
<p>In a few seconds more the danger was over.
In the meanwhile a big crowd commenced to collect
around the instructor and those who had set
off the fireworks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an outrage!&rdquo; fumed Professor Sharp.
&ldquo;An outrage! I&rsquo;ll have the law on you for it!&rdquo;
And he glared savagely at Tom and Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you can blame us, sir,&rdquo; answered
Tom, stoutly. &ldquo;We were just setting off
the fireworks when you ran right into the midst
of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! nonsense! You did it on purpose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly ran right into the things, just
as we had lit them,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how
you can blame us for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see! I shall report to Doctor Wallington
at once!&rdquo; stormed Asa Sharp, and hurried off
with his face drawn down in sour determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew! I guess we are in hot water, Tom!&rdquo;
whispered Sam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how he can blame us, Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in one way, we had no right to set off
the fireworks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! And why not, on the last day of the
term, I&rsquo;d like to know? The doctor saw us, and
he didn&rsquo;t say anything about stopping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really think it was Professor Sharp&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo;
said Allen Charter, who had been standing near.
&ldquo;He certainly ran right into the midst of the
lighted fireworks. I saw him do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you say a word for us, Charter, if we are
reported to the Head?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so will I,&rdquo; added Stanley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&mdash;if you won&rsquo;t make me carry that horrid
broom any longer,&rdquo; lisped William Philander
Tubbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I guess I&rsquo;m as much to blame as anybody!&rdquo;
came from Spud, who had followed Asa
Sharp from the college building. And then he
told of what had happened between himself, Filbury
and the instructor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if you hear any more about it,&rdquo; said
Charter. And he was practically right. The subject
was barely mentioned by Doctor Wallington,
and neither Tom nor Sam were censured for what
had occurred. And that was fair, for the Rover
boys had really not been to blame.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Later in the evening the college boys had
something of a feast. A number had &ldquo;chipped
in&rdquo; and bought some soda water, ginger ale, ice-cream
and cake in Ashton, and the improvised
feast was held in the boathouse, which was strung
with lanterns. Several of the students made
speeches, others sang, and Songbird was called on
to recite an original poem, a request that pleased
him greatly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, boys, Brill is a great place after all!&rdquo; remarked
Dick, when he and his brothers were retiring
for the night &ldquo;At first I thought I
shouldn&rsquo;t like it quite as well as dear old Putnam
Hall, but I am gradually changing my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place grows on one,&rdquo; returned Tom. &ldquo;I
suppose by the time we finish up here we&rsquo;ll hate
to leave, just as we hated to leave old Putnam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t be college boys so very long,&rdquo;
remarked Sam. &ldquo;Almost before you know it,
we&rsquo;ll be men and out in the world of business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And settled down, maybe, with a family of
children to support,&rdquo; added Tom, with a grin.</p>
<p>After the strenuous times of the evening before,
the Rovers were glad to take it easy on
Tuesday. They finished the last of their packing
and Tom played a last joke on William Philander
Tubbs by placing in the trunk of the fastidious
student a pair of old overalls and three old farm
hats found in the barn of Brill. They were hidden
in the middle of the dude&rsquo;s things, and he locked
up the trunk without discovering them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he unpacks that trunk when the ladies
are around,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Then he can show &rsquo;em
how he used to play farm hand, and wear three
big straw hats at a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad to part!&rdquo; sighed Songbird. &ldquo;Wish
we were all going on another treasure hunt!&rdquo; And
then he commenced to warble softly:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I love to sail the briny deep!</p>
<p class="t">The briny deep for me!</p>
<p class="t0">I love to watch the sunlit waves</p>
<p class="t">That brighten up the sea!</p>
<p class="t0">I love to listen to the wind</p>
<p class="t">That fills the snowy sails!</p>
<p class="t0">I love to roam around the deck&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">&ldquo;And eat the fishes&rsquo; tails!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>interrupted Tom. And then he went on:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I love to swim upon the sand,</p>
<p class="t">And dance upon the brine,</p>
<p class="t0">And write my name in salty waves,</p>
<p class="t">And hope for dinner time</p>
<p class="t0">To come, so I can eat my fill</p>
<p class="t">Of sea-foam snaps and cream;</p>
<p class="t0">And stand upon the quarter-deck</p>
<p class="t">A halfback of the team!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! do you call that poetry?&rdquo; snorted
Songbird. &ldquo;It sounds as much like it as a dog&rsquo;s
bark sounds like a hymn!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it would be a &lsquo;him&rsquo; if he was a gentleman
dog!&rdquo; retorted Tom, and then Songbird
turned away in momentary disgust. But soon his
good humor returned and Tom and the others allowed
him to &ldquo;spout poetry&rdquo; to his heart&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>It had been arranged that the Rovers, Dora, and
the Laning girls should meet at the Ashton depot,
and it is needless to say that the three boys were
on time. They were alone, for Songbird and
Stanley and some of their other chums were going
to take different trains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to let me hear from you this
summer!&rdquo; said Songbird, on parting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll be sure to write,&rdquo; answered Dick.
&ldquo;Come and see me&mdash;if you get anywhere near my
home,&rdquo; said Stanley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll remember that,&rdquo; returned Tom.</p>
<p>The boys were taken to Ashton depot in an automobile
belonging to the college. Their trunks
and dress-suit cases had preceded them, and as
soon as they arrived they had their baggage
checked straight through to Oak Run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see the girls&rsquo; trunks,&rdquo; announced Sam, who
had been looking the pile of baggage over. &ldquo;We
could get them checked, too, if we had their
tickets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder where the girls are?&rdquo; came from
Tom, as he looked at his watch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How much time, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten minutes yet&mdash;and this train will most
likely be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rather impatiently the Rover boys walked up
and down the platform. Presently they saw one
of the Hope carryalls coming and went to meet
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t in that,&rdquo; cried Sam, disappointedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another carriage coming from Hope?&rdquo;
queried Tom, of the carryall driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>The second carriage arrived a minute later. It
contained six girls and among them was Grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dora and Nellie are in the last carriage,&rdquo; announced
the younger Laning girl. &ldquo;I came on
ahead to get the trunks and bags checked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; answered Sam promptly. &ldquo;Got
the railroad tickets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, here they are,&rdquo; and Grace handed the
tickets over.</p>
<p>It took several minutes to check the baggage,
for the agent was busy, and all of the Rovers gave
a hand in shifting the heavy trunks out to a
place close to the tracks. Then Dick looked at
his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time for the train now,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;Wonder why that carriage doesn&rsquo;t get here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dick is getting nervous,&rdquo; said Sam, with a
wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are all right&mdash;with Grace here,&rdquo; retorted
his brother.</p>
<p>Tom had gone up to a bend of the road to take
a look. Now he came back with a shrug of his
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but a farm wagon in sight,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;And the horses are kicking up such a
dust I can&rsquo;t see behind it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom, is it time for the train?&rdquo; asked
Grace, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s three minutes past the time,&rdquo; answered
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the train is a good deal late,&rdquo; said Sam,
hopefully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask the agent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went off and in the meantime the others
continued to watch the country road leading to the
railroad station. All they could see was a cloud
of dust that betokened the coming of a big farm
wagon, on the front seat of which sat an old
farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The train is coming!&rdquo; cried Sam in dismay, on
returning. &ldquo;The agent says it will be here in
about two minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two minutes!&rdquo; burst out Dick and Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;ll get left!&rdquo; moaned Grace. &ldquo;What
shall we do? I can&rsquo;t go home alone! And I&rsquo;ve
got their tickets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the agent will hold the train a bit,&rdquo;
suggested Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear the train now!&rdquo; cried Sam, as a distant
whistle sounded through the air. A moment later
they saw the cars, making a broad curve around
the distant hills.</p>
<p>Dick ran to the man who sold tickets and looked
after the baggage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, we are waiting for some more passengers&mdash;some
young ladies from Hope Seminary,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you hold the train till they
come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; was the sharp answer. &ldquo;The
train is late already, and orders are to make as
short a stop as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are coming!&rdquo; yelled Tom. &ldquo;I see them
away down the road!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, call to them to hurry!&rdquo; burst out Grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t hear me,&rdquo; answered Tom. &ldquo;They
are coming as fast as the team can go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you hold the train just a couple of minutes?&rdquo;
pleaded Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; And the agent spoke with a positive
snap in his voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>Dick looked across the tracks. The farm
wagon had come up, and on the seat he recognized
the fat and jolly Mr. Sanderson, the father of the
girl they had once saved from the annoyances of
Dudd Flockley and Jerry Koswell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get Mr. Sanderson to do the trick for me!&rdquo;
he muttered to himself, and ran to where the farm
wagon had come to a halt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">DREAMS OF YOUTH</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sanderson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if it ain&rsquo;t Mr. Rover!&rdquo; cried the old
farmer. &ldquo;Glad to see ye! Bound fer hum, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Dick stepped close to the old farmer&rsquo;s
side. &ldquo;Mr. Sanderson do you want to do me a
great big favor and do it quick?&rdquo; he went on,
earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; course. Wot is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see that train coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as my eyesight is putty good, I do,&rdquo;
and the old farmer chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you see that carriage on the road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;it&rsquo;s one of them turnouts from the gals&rsquo;
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of our friends are in that carriage and
I want to hold that train till they get here,&rdquo;
continued Dick, quickly. &ldquo;The station agent
won&rsquo;t hold the train for me&mdash;so I want you to do
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Me? I ain&rsquo;t got nuthin&rsquo; to do with the railroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that. But you can hold the train,
nevertheless. The train will stop just below this
crossing&mdash;it always does. When it is about ready
to start you drive on the track&mdash;and then your
horse balks, see? You try to start him but he
won&rsquo;t start. You fuss and pull, but the horse
don&rsquo;t budge until those young ladies are on the
train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gum! I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; exclaimed the fat farmer,
with a twinkle in his eyes. &ldquo;This hoss is jest the
one to balk, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can depend on you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You kin, Mr. Rover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you a thousand times!&rdquo; returned Dick;
and then he went off to rejoin his brothers and
Grace.</p>
<p>The train had already rolled in and passengers
were getting off and on, and the agent was loading
on the trunks and handbags.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if they would only hurry!&rdquo; cried Grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can get aboard,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;This train
won&rsquo;t leave just yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it is going to go before they get here,&rdquo;
declared Sam. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame! Two minutes more
would fix it&mdash;and they could hold the train as well
as not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; sang out the conductor, as the
last of the baggage disappeared into the baggage
car.</p>
<p>Dick looked ahead. Mr. Sanderson&rsquo;s farm
wagon had just started to cross the tracks. He
was sawing on the reins and the horse was acting
in a strange manner, not knowing what to make
of it. He turned part way around and faced the
locomotive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;G&rsquo;lang!&rdquo; sang out the old farmer. &ldquo;Consarn
ye! What&rsquo;s the matter of ye, Franky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dick, he&rsquo;ll be killed!&rdquo; burst out Sam, in
horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if the horse wanted to climb over
the engine,&rdquo; came from Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; answered the elder Rover boy
in a whisper. &ldquo;The engineer sees him and won&rsquo;t
start the train. Mr. Sanderson is doing it on purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On purpose?&rdquo; came from Sam and Tom, and
then of a sudden they understood, and both had
to turn away to hide the grins that broke out on
their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead!&rdquo; cried the conductor, and then he
saw the trouble and ran forward to watch proceedings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>From the antics of the horse in front of the
locomotive, the Rover boys turned their attention
to the carriage that was approaching. As it came
closer they saw Dora and Nellie waving their
hands frantically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! Wait for us!&rdquo; cried out Dora, and as
the carriage came to a stop she leaped out, followed
by Nellie and the other girl students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just in time!&rdquo; sang out Dick, loudly. &ldquo;Come
on, here is our car!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what made you so late?&rdquo; asked Grace.
&ldquo;We have been worried to death about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the girls forgot her pocketbook and
we had to drive back for it,&rdquo; explained Nellie.
&ldquo;Oh, we thought sure we would miss the train,
when we saw it stop. We were so far off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain why you caught it later on,&rdquo; whispered
Dick. &ldquo;Now excuse me a moment,&rdquo; and
he ran towards the locomotive.</p>
<p>A crowd had commenced to collect, and several
folks were offering Mr. Sanderson advice. But
though he seemed to try his best, his horse and
wagon remained in front of the train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, let me aid you, Mr. Sanderson,&rdquo; cried
Dick, and gave the farmer the wink. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all
right,&rdquo; he added, in a whisper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m your friend
for life after this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to be of service,&rdquo; answered the old farmer,
in an equally low tone. &ldquo;G&rsquo;lang, Franky!&rdquo;
he roared suddenly, and touched the horse with
his whip. At once the animal turned partly
around and ran off the tracks and down the country
road as if nothing out of the ordinary had
happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound that fool nag!&rdquo; muttered the conductor
of the train, as he consulted his watch.
&ldquo;Here we&rsquo;ve lost six minutes more. Tom, can you
make it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can try,&rdquo; answered the engineer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right! Let her go!&rdquo; And Dick and the
other passengers who had gone forward hopped
on the train in a hurry, and the conductor followed.
The train official did not suspect that the
&ldquo;blockading&rdquo; had been done purposely, and Dick
did not enlighten him.</p>
<p>The Rovers had secured seats for the girls and
themselves in one of the parlor cars, and all were
together. As the train rolled onward Dick related
the particulars of the trick that had been
played with the aid of Mr. Sanderson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dick, how could you think of such a
thing?&rdquo; cried Dora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it just popped into my mind,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;And Mr. Sanderson acted his part to
perfection. Aren&rsquo;t you glad we did something
to hold the train?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you have gone on without us?&rdquo; asked
Nellie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a step!&rdquo; answered Tom, and spoke the
words so quickly and earnestly that everybody in
the party laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to miss this train for two reasons,&rdquo;
went on Dick. &ldquo;In the first place, we&rsquo;d
lose our parlor-car seats, and in the second place,
we&rsquo;d have to wait four hours for another train,
and that nothing but a slow accommodation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t mind a slow train&mdash;while we
have such good company,&rdquo; observed Sam, and for
this remark Grace gave him a warm look of appreciation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had any further news from home?&rdquo;
asked Dick, of Dora, a little later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a letter from mamma yesterday. She
says Professor Crabtree called again. But she
had the maid go to the door, and she refused to
see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Did he say anything to the
maid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says he went away looking very angry and
muttering something about making mamma see
him. Mamma watched him from an upper window
and she wrote that he hung around the garden
about half an hour before he went away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The rascal! You had better get Mr. Laning
to look into this for you. If he bothers you any
more he ought to be locked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I think. But mamma is too timid to
go to the police, or anything like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I was there when old Crabtree called&mdash;I&rsquo;d
give him a piece of my mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dick, maybe he would want to&mdash;to&mdash;shoot
you, or something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Josiah Crabtree isn&rsquo;t that kind. He belongs
to the snake-in-the-grass variety of rascals.
But perhaps he won&rsquo;t come again&mdash;now that your
mother has refused to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could be sure of it,&rdquo; sighed the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done about the fortune,
Dora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma has everything in the vault of a safe
deposit company in Ithaca. We don&rsquo;t know just
what to do&mdash;thinking Tad Sobber may tie the
money up again in the courts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how he can do that&mdash;unless he
brings up some new evidence to prove that the
fortune belongs to Sid Merrick&rsquo;s estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle John thought it might be best to buy
Tad Sobber off&mdash;just to end the matter. But
Sobber wanted too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d not give him a cent&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t deserve it&mdash;after
the way he treated you, and us. I don&rsquo;t
believe Sid Merrick ever had a right to one dollar
of the fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose Crabtree came around because he
heard that you had more money than ever. Gracious,
Dora, some day you&rsquo;ll be real rich in your
own name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, won&rsquo;t you like it,&rdquo; she demanded
brightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not complain. But I&rsquo;d take you just as
quickly if you were poor,&rdquo; added Dick earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you doubt me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dick, I don&rsquo;t. I know you don&rsquo;t want me
for my money,&rdquo; and Dora leaned forward to let
her hand rest for a moment on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a little money of my own,&rdquo; he went
on, after a pause, in which they looked straight
into each other&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little! Oh, Dick, I guess you&rsquo;ve got a good
bit more than I&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sorry for that, Dora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry? Oh, no, but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And Dora
suddenly turned very red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, dear?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;I&mdash;that is&mdash;you said you would take
me just as quickly if I were poor. Well&mdash;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d
take you that way, too!&rdquo; And now the girl hid
her blushes in her handkerchief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dora, you&rsquo;re a darling, and true-blue!&rdquo; whispered
Dick, fervidly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pull together, rich
or poor, and be happy, see if we don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First call for lunch!&rdquo; announced a waiter,
coming through the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that hits me!&rdquo; came from Tom. &ldquo;I had
such a slim breakfast I am hollow clear to my
shoes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A slim breakfast!&rdquo; sniffed Sam. &ldquo;Fruit, sawdust
and cream, fried eggs with bacon, half a
dozen muffins, and coffee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out! You&rsquo;re thinking of your own breakfast!&rdquo;
retorted Tom. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s lead the
way&mdash;before the dining car fills up.&rdquo; And he
caught Nellie by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;re coming!&rdquo; cried Sam, and
followed with Grace. &ldquo;Come on, Dick!&rdquo; And
he motioned to the others. Soon all were moving
towards the dining car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well do a little practicing,&rdquo; was
Tom&rsquo;s comment, on the way, and linking his arm
into that of Nellie, he began very softly to whistle
a well-known wedding march.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom Rover!&rdquo; cried Nellie, giving him a
playful poke in the side. &ldquo;Of all things! And in
a railroad car! I&rsquo;ve a good mind not to walk
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll change the tune,&rdquo; cried Tom,
cheerfully, and commenced to whistle a funeral
dirge, at which all of the girls shrieked with
laughter.</p>
<p>It was a jolly crowd that sat down to the tables
in the dining car, and the Rover boys saw to it
that the girls were provided with whatever they
desired on the bill of fare. They took their time
over the meal, and the fun they had made even
the waiters smile broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get to Cartown in an hour,&rdquo; said Sam,
after they had returned to the parlor car. &ldquo;And
then we&rsquo;ll have to say good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s too bad!&rdquo; pouted Grace. &ldquo;I wish
you were going through to Cedarville with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the best of friends must part, as the
oyster said to the shell,&rdquo; observed Tom, and at
this joke the others smiled faintly. But now that
they were to separate so soon all felt rather sober.
Little did they dream of the exciting occurrence
that was to bring them together again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">HOME ONCE MORE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;And now for Oak Run and home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Dick who spoke, as he and his brothers
boarded another train at Cartown. The girls had
gone on in the first train and the boys had had
to wait half an hour for the one on the line
which would take them close to Valley Brook
farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home it is!&rdquo; returned Sam. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll be
glad to see dad again&mdash;and the rest of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, Sam,&rdquo; joined in Tom. &ldquo;After
all, there is no place like home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember how you used to hate the farm,
Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that was when we got too much of it.
I don&rsquo;t like all farm and nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Uncle Randolph has any new
fads this summer?&rdquo; came from Dick. Their uncle
was more or less of a scientific farmer, and
was always trying new ways, and usually losing
money on them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got bees in his bonnet,&rdquo; answered Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded Dick, indignantly.
&ldquo;Tom, Uncle Randolph is no more crazy than you
are. He has a right to experiment if he wants to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said he was crazy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said &lsquo;he has bees in his bonnet.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s the
same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; answered Tom dryly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got
bees on the brain&mdash;if that suits you better. Aunt
Martha wrote me that he had invested in half a
dozen hives of bees, and got a queen bee worth I
don&rsquo;t know how much to boss the colony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so he&rsquo;s going into bee culture!&rdquo; murmured
Dick. &ldquo;I hope he doesn&rsquo;t get stung.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be stung right enough,&rdquo; answered Sam.
&ldquo;If not in one way then in another. He never
makes his experiments pay. Say, I rather think
I&rsquo;ll steer clear of those bees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can have some fun with them,&rdquo;
mused Tom, and immediately commenced to lay
plans for that purpose.</p>
<p>They had a three hours&rsquo; ride to Oak Run and
on the way made several stops of more or less
importance. At one place, near the depot, was a
cigar store, and Tom left the train and came back
with three cigars of large size in his hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with those,&rdquo; questioned
Sam, &ldquo;learn to smoke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am going to treat some of my particular
friends,&rdquo; answered Tom, and winked one eye,
suggestively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let me in on the joke!&rdquo; pleaded his younger
brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is then,&rdquo; answered Tom, and brought
from his pocket a small round wooden box. Taking
off the cover he disclosed to view some pellets
that were coated with what looked like silver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; questioned Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fireworks catalogue called them Serpent&rsquo;s
Eggs. You light one and the first thing you know
it commences to swell up&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, and then pushes out just like a great
big worm, or snake!&rdquo; finished Sam. &ldquo;I had a box
of &rsquo;em last year. And are you going&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To put them in the cigars. They are harmless,
but we can get some fun out of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; concluded
Tom.</p>
<p>It was an easy matter to cut out a portion of
the tobacco from the smoking end of each cigar,
and this done Tom inserted three of the pellets
in each. Then he placed the cigars carefully in his
pocket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>On the way to Oak Run the three lads discussed
the doings at Brill, and also the news concerning
Tad Sobber and Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both of these rascals would like to get their
hands on the Stanhope fortune,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but in different ways,&rdquo; returned Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, neither of &rsquo;em shall get his hands on a
dollar&mdash;if I can help it,&rdquo; answered Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think Crabtree would be ashamed to
show himself,&rdquo; went on Sam. &ldquo;If I was in his
place, I&rsquo;d travel to some new part of the globe,
change my name, and make a new try at living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one way I am sorry for him,&rdquo; was Dick&rsquo;s
comment. &ldquo;A man coming out of prison hasn&rsquo;t
much chance to get work. Nobody will trust him,
no matter if he does want to be honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose Crabtree has any money?&rdquo;
asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last they were only a few miles from Oak
Run, and they gathered up the few things they
were carrying, fishing rods, cameras, and a small
valise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oak Run!&rdquo; cried the porter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, the first to
get off. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything of Jack Ness,&rdquo; he
added, mentioning the hired man from the farm,
who usually came for them with the team.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He may be a little late&mdash;Jack often is,&rdquo; answered
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I shan&rsquo;t mind it,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I want
to see my old friend Mr. Ricks,&rdquo; and he winked at
Sam.</p>
<p>The station master at Oak Run was a crabbed
old individual who rarely had a pleasant word for
anybody. But he was faithful and probably that
was why the railroad continued to employ him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how do you do, Mr. Ricks, I am real
glad to see you!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, as he rushed up
after the train had gone and caught the station
master by the hand. &ldquo;It seems like old times to
get back here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! Got back, eh?&rdquo; muttered Mr. Ricks
sourly. &ldquo;Thought you boys went to college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we did. We are back for the summer holidays.
You are looking well, Mr. Ricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t very well, I&rsquo;ve got dyspepsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so. Why don&rsquo;t you smoke more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Smoking is the best thing in the world
for dyspepsia. Cured the king of England and
the emperor of Germany. Here, have a cigar,
and see how much better you feel after smoking
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>Now, as it happened, Ricks loved cigars, although
he usually smoked a pipe, that being
cheaper. He took the big cigar that Tom handed
out and started to place it in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, light up,&rdquo; cried Tom, and produced a
match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll smoke after I git my ticket money counted
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, light up now,&rdquo; said Tom, and struck the
match. &ldquo;I want you to get the benefit of that
cigar at once. It&rsquo;s a special brand and I am sure
it will knock that dyspepsia higher than an airship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ricks lit up as desired and took several long
whiffs from the cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like it?&rdquo; questioned Tom, while
Sam and Dick watched proceedings closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Putty good,&rdquo; returned the station master. The
cigars had cost Tom ten cents each and they were
better than those Ricks usually smoked.</p>
<p>A carriage had rolled up to the station and the
boys saw Jack Ness coming towards them. He
shook hands and then went off to get their trunks
and bags, to be placed in a farm wagon driven by
a neighbor&rsquo;s boy.</p>
<p>Ricks entered his ticket office and then walked
to the back platform of the station, where several
farmers were congregated, sitting on some empty
milk cans, talking crops. The boys continued to
watch him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, where did ye get the smoke?&rdquo; asked
one of the farmers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ricks is gittin&rsquo; high-toned,&rdquo; said another.
&ldquo;Fust thing you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got no further, for just then Ricks caught
sight of the smoking end of his cigar and his eyes
stared wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s th&mdash;that!&rdquo; he gasped, and took the
cigar from his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gosh! Are ye raisin&rsquo; snakes, Ricks?&rdquo; cried
one of the farmers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon he&rsquo;s struck a nest o&rsquo; worms!&rdquo; commented
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what do yo&mdash;you think it is?&rdquo; groaned
Ricks. He was so amazed that he could do little
but stare at the cigar, from the end of which a
snake-like curl was issuing, larger and larger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you buy that cigar?&rdquo; asked one of
the farmers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t buy it&mdash;Tom Rover gave it to me!&rdquo;
answered Ricks. &ldquo;Say, this is a put-up job!&rdquo; he
roared, and dashed the cigar to the ground.
&ldquo;Where is that imp, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Mr. Ricks!&rdquo; sang out Tom from
the carriage. &ldquo;Hope you enjoy that smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You come back here!&rdquo; stormed the station
master. &ldquo;Just you let me get my fingers on you,
that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; And he shook his fist at the fun-loving
youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trick cigar, that&rsquo;s what it is,&rdquo; announced
one of the farmers, and commenced to edge away.
&ldquo;Maybe it will blow up soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s so, I&rsquo;m going to get out!&rdquo; cried another,
and slid from the milk cans in a hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you don&rsquo;t suppose he put dynnymite in it,
do you?&rdquo; asked Ricks, fearfully. &ldquo;He might
blow up the whole station. He blew up a fire
once I was building,&rdquo; he added, referring to a
joke Tom had once played on him, the particulars
of which have already been set forth in &ldquo;The
Rover Boys at School.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better put the cigar in a pail of water,&rdquo; suggested
one farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do it, Snell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it yourself, if you want it done,&rdquo; answered
Snell, and very gingerly Ricks gathered up the
cigar and its &ldquo;worms&rdquo; on a shovel and cast them
into a tub of rain water that was handy. The
others gathered around, joked the station master
unmercifully and he vowed that he would get
square with Tom sooner or later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>In the meantime the Rover boys lost no time
in leaving the railroad station. They had Jack
Ness urge on the team, and soon they were crossing
the Swift River and driving through the village
of Dexter&rsquo;s Corners. Several folks of the
village saw them and waved them a welcome, for
the lads were great favorites. Then they started
along the country road leading to Valley Brook
farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how are all the folks, Jack?&rdquo; asked
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All fairly well, sir,&rdquo; answered the hired man.
&ldquo;Your uncle, he got &rsquo;em rather bad last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of his new bees stung him&mdash;and they
stung me, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad!&rdquo; murmured Dick. &ldquo;Any other
news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of none. The hay crop is going
to be heavy, so they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we need hay for the stock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We miss you boys, so we do,&rdquo; went on the
hired man. &ldquo;When you are away the farm is like
as if we was havin&rsquo; a funeral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll warm you up,&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Eh,
Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try to, anyway,&rdquo; answered the youngest
Rover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to have a great Fourth of July
celebration,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I ordered some fireworks
for home at the same time I had those sent
to the college,&rdquo; he added, to his brothers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll have to celebrate in fine style,&rdquo; answered
Dick.</p>
<p>They went on, and soon a turn of the road
brought them in sight of the farmhouse nestling
so cozily among the hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home again!&rdquo; sang out Tom. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give
them a call!&rdquo; And he set up a cheer, in which the
others readily joined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see dad!&rdquo; cried Sam, a moment later, as his
father appeared around a corner of the house
and waved his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is Uncle Randolph, down among his
bee hives,&rdquo; added Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Aunt Martha is on the piazza!&rdquo; came
from Sam. &ldquo;And there is Aleck Pop!&rdquo; he continued,
as the ebony face of a smiling negro
showed itself from between the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, I am glad to welcome you home again!&rdquo;
cried Anderson Rover, as the carriage rolled up
and the lads leaped out in a bunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we are glad to see you, dad!&rdquo; they answered
in a chorus, and shook hands. Then Tom
made one leap for the piazza and fairly lifted his
aunt from her feet. &ldquo;How are you, Aunt Martha!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom, yo&mdash;you bear!&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Rover,
but with a beaming face. &ldquo;My boy, how big you
are getting!&rdquo; And then she kissed him heartily,
and kissed the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back again! and welcome!&rdquo; said Randolph
Rover, as he walked up quickly. Then he, too,
shook hands; and all went into the house.</p>

<p>It was a great home-coming. As was to be expected,
Aunt Martha had had the cook prepare a
most elaborate supper, and, to this the lads did
full justice. The long ride on the cars had tired
them, yet they remained up long enough to tell
about affairs at college, and learn what their father
and their other relatives had to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this is like old times!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick,
as he entered his bedroom. &ldquo;Looks as natural as
it ever did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyt&rsquo;ing I can do fo&rsquo; yo&rsquo; young gen&rsquo;men?&rdquo;
asked a voice from the doorway, and Aleck Pop
showed himself, his mouth on a grin from ear to
ear. Indeed Aleck had not stopped grinning since
the boys had appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of, Aleck,&rdquo; answered Dick.
&ldquo;How have you been since we went away?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t been well, sah,&rdquo; answered the colored
man, and his face fell for a moment. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been
dat awful lonesome lik I thinks I was a gwine to
die sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Aleck, we&rsquo;ll cheer you up some
day,&rdquo; came from Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I ought to be at a boahdin&rsquo; school, or
a collidge,&rdquo; went on Aleck. &ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;ll go back
to Putnam Hall&mdash;if de cap&rsquo;n will take me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll take you back fast enough,&rdquo; answered
Sam. &ldquo;But why not try for a place at Brill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; collidge? Would da hab me dar, yo&rsquo;
t&rsquo;ink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. They have some colored help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Den say, won&rsquo;t you put in a good word fo&rsquo;
me, all ob yo&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Aleck, earnestly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
gib most anyt&rsquo;ing fo&rsquo; to be wid yo&rsquo;, &rsquo;deed I
would!&rdquo; and his eyes rolled from one lad to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep that in mind, Aleck,&rdquo; answered
Dick. &ldquo;But you can be with us this summer&mdash;at
least part of the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;se glad ob dat, Massa Dick. I&rsquo;se jess been
a-pinin&rsquo; an&rsquo; a-pinin&rsquo; fo&rsquo; you boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys slept soundly, and did not get up until
late. They spent the best part of the day in
roaming around the farm, and in writing letters
to the girls, telling of their safe arrival home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;d like to do,&rdquo; said Tom,
that afternoon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to invite the Lanings
and the Stanhopes down here to spend the Fourth
of July. We might have a sort of house party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; shouted Sam. &ldquo;Just the thing&mdash;if
they&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us sound dad and Uncle Randolph and
Aunt Martha on the subject,&rdquo; added Dick.</p>
<p>The matter was talked over, and the boys readily
secured permission to have their friends at the
farm for the best part of a week. The invitations
were issued immediately, for the national holiday
was but ten days off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;d like to do, after they are
gone,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to take our tent and
go camping up the river for a week or two, just
for the novelty of it. We could fish and swim,
and take it easy, and have lots of sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me down to the ground,&rdquo; answered Tom.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it&mdash;unless something better turns up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to suggest an automobile tour,&rdquo;
said Sam. &ldquo;Uncle Randolph has the new car and
it is certainly a dandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe we can take the tour, too,&rdquo; answered
Dick. &ldquo;The summer vacation will be
pretty long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could run up to Cedarville,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;right to the Lanings&rsquo; home,&rdquo; added
Dick, giving Tom a poke in the ribs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure&mdash;and over to the Stanhopes&rsquo; place,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having sent their letters the boys waited anxiously
for replies. On Saturday the answers
came, and they read the communications with
deep interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! Nellie and Grace are coming, with
their mother!&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Dora is coming with them,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Mrs. Stanhope?&rdquo; asked Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said she might come, but she wasn&rsquo;t sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A letter had been written by Mrs. Rover to
Mrs. Laning and there was a reply to this, both
from Mrs. Laning and Mrs. Stanhope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a great celebration!&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about those fireworks?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect them today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got enough?&rdquo; asked Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As many as we had at Brill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ordered some powder, too, for use in the old
cannon,&rdquo; went on Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wake up the
natives this Fourth all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look out that you don&rsquo;t blow yourself
up,&rdquo; warned Dick, for he knew his fun-loving
brother could get rather reckless at times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll be on guard,&rdquo; was Tom&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>When Tom went to Oak Run to get the fireworks
old Ricks was decidedly grouchy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a good mind not to let you have &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
growled the station master. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have no
right to play that trick on me with that cigar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What trick?&rdquo; demanded Tom, innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know well enough, you scamp!
Think it&rsquo;s smart to put off a cigar on me thet
swells up and busts out worms! Bah! you keep
your cigars to yourself after this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, if you want me to,&rdquo; answered Tom,
meekly, and then, watching his chance, he placed
another of the &ldquo;doctored&rdquo; cigars in Ricks&rsquo; office,
where he had a cigar box with tickets in it. Then
he, with Jack Ness&rsquo; aid, loaded his fireworks and
the small box of powder on the farm wagon.</p>
<p>As Tom worked he watched Ricks narrowly
and saw the station agent enter his office to sell
tickets. While he was making change he chanced
to look into the cigar box with the tickets, and
Tom, peeping through a crack of the door, saw
him take up the cigar and look at it wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; murmured Ricks. &ldquo;I thought that
box was empty. Sallers must have left this in
it when he gave it to me. That&rsquo;s one on Bob.
Guess I&rsquo;ll smoke it up before he comes an&rsquo; asks
me about it.&rdquo; The man he mentioned was a storekeeper
of the vicinity, who had given him the
cigar box the evening before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>Ricks struck a match and commenced to puff
away with satisfaction. By this time the wagon
was loaded and Tom directed Jack Ness to drive
off to the bridge and wait for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye, Mr. Ricks,&rdquo; said the fun-loving
youth, as he stepped up to the ticket window.
&ldquo;Hope you don&rsquo;t hold any hard feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You quit your foolin&rsquo;!&rdquo; growled the station
master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re smoking another cigar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if I am? Ain&rsquo;t I got a right to smoke
if I want to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you see things when you do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See things? Wot do you mean, Tom Rover?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tell me that you imagined you saw
snakes the other day when you were smoking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go on about your business! You played
me a trick, that&rsquo;s what you did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer how cigars affect some people. They
get nervous and think the end of the cigar is
crawling,&rdquo; went on Tom, earnestly. &ldquo;Now, if I
was affected that way I wouldn&rsquo;t smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Tom Rover, I want you to understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>What the station agent wanted Tom to know
was never divulged, for at that instant the cigar
commenced to swell at the lit end and then an
ashy-colored &ldquo;worm&rdquo; commenced slowly to uncurl,
reaching a length of a foot or more. Ricks
took the cigar in his hand, held it at arm&rsquo;s length
and viewed it with horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s another one of &rsquo;em!&rdquo; he groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Mr. Ricks?&rdquo; asked Tom,
calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This cigar! Did&mdash;did you play this trick on
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the end o&rsquo; this cigar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything wrong. It looks like a
fine cigar, and it seems to burn well,&rdquo; answered
Tom, as soberly as a judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see the&mdash;the worms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worms! Mr. Ricks you are dreaming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that a&mdash;er&mdash;a worm?&rdquo; shouted the station
master, pointing with his finger at the thing
dangling at the end of the cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ricks, you must have &rsquo;em again,&rdquo; answered
Tom, and looked deeply shocked. &ldquo;You
had better go and see a doctor. This cigar smoking
has got on your nerves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t so! I see the worms! There they
are!&rdquo; And the station master poked his finger
into the mass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>Now, as those who are acquainted with the
fireworks known as Serpent&rsquo;s Eggs, or Pharaoh&rsquo;s
Serpents, know, the &ldquo;worms&rdquo; or &ldquo;serpents&rdquo; are
very fragile and go to dust at the slightest touch.
Consequently when Ricks placed his finger rudely
on those at the end of the cigar they were knocked
off, and falling to the floor, were completely shattered
to dust. At this the station master started
in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the worms?&rdquo; asked Tom. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;they were here!&rdquo;
stammered Ricks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the end o&rsquo; the cigar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where are they now?&rdquo; demanded Tom.
&ldquo;Give me one, till I examine it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why they&mdash;they are&mdash;er&mdash;gone now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Say, I don&rsquo;t know about this!&rdquo; And
the old station master commenced to scratch his
head. He looked at the cigar wonderingly. But
no more &ldquo;worms&rdquo; were forthcoming, for the reason
that the pellets Tom had placed within had
burnt themselves out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly ought to see a doctor&mdash;or else
give up smoking cigars,&rdquo; said Tom, as soberly as
ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Rover, ain&rsquo;t this no trick o&rsquo; yours?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Trick? Do you think I am a wizard? I find
you smoking a cigar and you go and see worms,
or snakes, just as if you had been drinking.
Maybe you do drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. I ain&rsquo;t teched a drop in six months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you had better do something for yourself,&rdquo;
said Tom, as he backed away from the
ticket window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand this, nohow!&rdquo; muttered
the old station master. &ldquo;But I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to
smoke thet cigar no more!&rdquo; he added, and threw
the weed out on the railroad tracks.</p>
<p>When Tom got to the wagon he was shaking
with laughter. The joke was too good to keep,
and as they drove along he told Jack Ness about
what had occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one on Ricks,&rdquo; said the hired man, with a
broad grin. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s kind o&rsquo; a superstitious man
an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll imagine all sorts o&rsquo; things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it cures him of smoking it will be a
good job done,&rdquo; answered Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him
with a pipe in his mouth when a lady wanted a
railroad ticket, and he would blow the smoke
right into her face.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>It made Randolph Rover somewhat nervous to
have so many fireworks and so much powder
around the premises&mdash;and there was a good reason
for this, for the facilities for fighting fire
at Valley Brook were very meager. So, to please
his uncle, Tom stored the stuff in a small building
at the bottom of one of the fields, where some
farming implements and berry crates and boxes
were kept.</p>
<p>The cannon Tom had mentioned was a rather
old affair. But it seemed to be in good condition
and the boys spent some time in cleaning it out
and putting it in condition for use. It was mounted
on a big block and set in the middle of the
lawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I reckon we are ready to celebrate!&rdquo;
cried Sam, after all the preparations were complete.
&ldquo;And we ought to have a dandy time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will have,&rdquo; answered Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best ever!&rdquo; chimed in Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">WHEN THE CANNON WENT OFF</span></h2>
<p>The boys went down to the railroad station in
the new touring car to meet Mrs. Laning and the
three girls, and possibly Mrs. Stanhope. The
car was a fine seven-seat affair, of forty-horse
power, and Dick ran it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the slickest thing in cars I&rsquo;ve seen!&rdquo; cried
the eldest Rover boy, enthusiastically. &ldquo;A tour
in it would be great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have to take a tour in it before
the summer is over,&rdquo; returned Sam.</p>
<p>The train was late and the boys waited impatiently
for it to put in an appearance. When it
did arrive they were delighted to see that Mrs.
Laning had induced Mrs. Stanhope to come along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted her to come for two reasons,&rdquo; whispered
Dick to Dora, after the first greetings were
over. &ldquo;I wished her here, and I was afraid, if
she remained behind, Josiah Crabtree might try
to visit her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He did try, Dick,&rdquo; answered the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and what do you think? We had another
visit from Tad Sobber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wanted us to give him half of the fortune.
Said that if we didn&rsquo;t he would never rest
until he got the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did your mother do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had two hired men, who happened to be
at the house, put him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! That&rsquo;s the best way to treat him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma was very much upset, as you can
imagine. And the very next day Josiah Crabtree
called, and what do you think he said? He
sent word by the maid that he had called not
alone on his own behalf, but also on behalf of
Sobber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so that&rsquo;s the way the wind blows, eh?
They are going to form a sort of partnership, to
see if they can&rsquo;t get hold of your money, by one
way or another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks that way, Dick, and I am worried to
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to run Sobber down and put him in
prison. He has done a number of things for
which he might be arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am trying to get mamma to take a trip
somewhere. I want her to go in secret, so that
Sobber and Mr. Crabtree can&rsquo;t follow her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be a good thing, Dora,&rdquo; answered
Dick, and then he had to turn his attention to running
the touring car. Although the automobile
was built for but seven, all had crowded in, Sam
sitting in front on Tom&rsquo;s lap, and the ladies and
girls occupying the tonneau.</p>
<p>The run to the farm took but a few minutes,
Dick &ldquo;letting the machine out&rdquo; in a manner that
made the ladies gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never rode so fast in my life, on a country
road!&rdquo; declared Mrs. Laning, on alighting. &ldquo;It
was like a train!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was nothing,&rdquo; answered Tom. &ldquo;We
can go twice as fast if we want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not with me in the car!&rdquo; declared the lady,
firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a splendid automobile,&rdquo; said Mrs. Stanhope.
&ldquo;But I shouldn&rsquo;t care to travel at racing
speed in one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The visitors were warmly welcomed by Mrs.
Rover and her husband and by the boys&rsquo; father,
and soon all were made to feel at home. The best
rooms in the farmhouse were given over to the
guests, and Mrs. Rover had placed a beautiful
bunch of June roses in each apartment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What lovely roses!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Stanhope.
&ldquo;We have some, but not as grand as these!&rdquo; And
her face showed her satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to have you girls here!&rdquo; declared
Sam. &ldquo;What a jolly family we would be if we
all lived together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what an idea!&rdquo; cried Grace, but she smiled
even as she spoke.</p>
<p>Of course the boys had to show the girls
all over the farm, and Uncle Randolph took the
ladies around, showing them the big barns and
the cattle, the chickens, the horses, the pigs, and
the orchards, and broad fields of corn, wheat,
and other products. Then they came back to
look at the neat vegetable garden, and Mrs. Rover&rsquo;s
flower plots, and also at the bees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope for great things from my bees,&rdquo; announced
Randolph Rover. &ldquo;I have taken up the
study of them with care, and I think I can produce
a variety that will give us extra fine clover
honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you had your bees all in one place,
Uncle Randolph,&rdquo; said Dick, as he noticed a hive
set apart from the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a new family I bought last week,&rdquo;
was the explanation. &ldquo;I am keeping them apart
for the purpose of studying them. But they are
rather wild as yet, and I do not dare to disturb
them very much.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t bear bees!&rdquo; whispered Nellie to
Tom. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here,&rdquo; and she walked
away, and the others followed.</p>
<p>Although the young folks remained up rather
late on the night before the Fourth, Tom, Dick
and Sam arranged among themselves to get up
early the next day, to fire a salute from the old
cannon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll surprise them all,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
show &rsquo;em we can make a noise even if we are in
the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys crept downstairs at five o&rsquo;clock and
hurried out to the shed where the powder had
been left. Bringing the box forth they took it to
where the old cannon had been placed on the lawn.
The piece was pointed towards an apple orchard,
so that it might do no damage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, fill her up good!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;We
want to make as much noise as we can with the
first shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put in such a load that she bursts,&rdquo;
cautioned Dick.</p>
<p>The powder was measured out and put in, and
then this was followed by a wad of paper Sam
brought from the kitchen. They rammed the
paper in good and tight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I guess she&rsquo;s ready to set off,&rdquo; said
Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tom, don&rsquo;t you stand too close,&rdquo; said Dick.
&ldquo;That cannon might explode. Light the slow
match and then run behind a tree, or the corner
of the piazza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Dick. But I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll explode,&rdquo;
was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, goin&rsquo; to fire her off, eh?&rdquo; came a voice
from the fence, and Jack Ness appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jack,&rdquo; answered Sam. &ldquo;But keep still&mdash;we
want to surprise the folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough,&rdquo; murmured the hired man.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do it right enough. Thet old cannon always
was a snorter fer noise.&rdquo; And he backed
away towards the orchard to get behind a tree,
out of the way of possible harm.</p>
<p>All being ready, Tom lit a match and applied it
to the slow match of the cannon. Then he ran
for the corner of the piazza, to join his brothers.</p>
<p>A few seconds passed&mdash;they seemed unusually
long just then&mdash;but nothing happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The slow match must have gone out,&rdquo; murmured
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go back!&mdash;it may go off, yet,&rdquo; answered
Dick. &ldquo;Sometimes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bang! went the cannon, and the tremendous report
echoed and re-echoed throughout the hills
surrounding Valley Brook. The charge had
been so big that the piece had &ldquo;kicked back&rdquo; about
a yard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that was a noise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that didn&rsquo;t wake the folks up nothing will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad she didn&rsquo;t burst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gum, you&rsquo;re celebratin&rsquo; all right!&rdquo; came
from Jack Ness, as he poked his head from behind
a tree. &ldquo;I guess they must have heard that
clear down to the Corners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Further than that!&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom, did you do that?&rdquo; came a voice
from an upper window, and Nellie showed her
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an awful noise!&rdquo; came from another
window, as Dora appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it wake you up?&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It made me bounce right out of bed!&rdquo; declared
Nellie. &ldquo;I thought I was shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the house had been hit,&rdquo; said Dora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did your cannon burst?&rdquo; questioned Grace, as
she appeared beside Nellie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it!&rdquo; declared Tom. &ldquo;Just listen,
while we fire another shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom, wait till I put some cotton in my
ears!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Rover, as she showed herself,
followed by the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, you didn&rsquo;t shoot off anything in the
cannon, did you?&rdquo; asked Randolph Rover, nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but powder and paper, Uncle,&rdquo; answered
Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t so!&rdquo; suddenly shouted Jack Ness.
&ldquo;By gum! You hit the bee hive, an&rsquo; here come
the bees! Gee, shoo! Git out! Oh, my! I&rsquo;m
stung!&rdquo; And he started to run from the orchard.</p>
<p>The boys stared for a moment. Down in the
orchard was the hive which their uncle had set
apart from the others. It seemed to be torn at
the top, and a swarm of angry bees were flying
around. Part of the swarm had made for Jack
Ness, and now the hired man was running for his
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t see how we hit the hive&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
commenced Dick, when a yell from Sam interrupted
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bees! The bees! Some of &rsquo;em are heading
this way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! hi! don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em fly away!&rdquo; screamed
Randolph Rover. &ldquo;They are very valuable! Stop
them! Make them go back in the hive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me from touching any bees!&rdquo; murmured
Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get out of here!&rdquo;
And he started to run.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go to the house!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t want the ladies and the girls to get stung.
Head for the barn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His brothers understood, and they scampered
at top speed for the nearest barn. In the meantime
they could see poor Jack Ness slashing
around wildly with a coat he was carrying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Git out o&rsquo; here, you troublesome critters!&rdquo;
screamed the hired man. &ldquo;Lemme alone, consarn
ye! Oh, my nose! Oh, my eye!&rdquo; And then he
pelted for the vegetable garden. Here he fell
over a hot-bed frame and went sprawling. But
he soon picked himself up, and then he streaked
it down the garden to a patch of corn, gradually
outdistancing his little tormentors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this is the worst yet!&rdquo; groaned Tom, and
he and his brothers watched the bees from a distance.
&ldquo;However did we happen to hit that
hive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;unless
you put something in the cannon. Did you use
stones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Did you, Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing but that paper. But we rammed
that down rather hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think paper would reach to the orchard.
Maybe there was something in it. Did
you look?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. Come to think of it, it did feel a little
hard,&rdquo; answered Sam.</p>
<p>In a few minutes Randolph Rover appeared,
followed by the boys&rsquo; father. The man who was
making a study of bees had placed a net over his
head and donned gloves, and thus equipped he
went down to look at the hive. A small corner of
the top had been torn away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy the bees will settle down before a
great while,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The hive is not much
damaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear that, Uncle Randolph,&rdquo; said
Tom. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think that shot would reach so
far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time you had better point the cannon into
the air,&rdquo; replied the uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea; we will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cook slept at the top of the house, and
awakened by the noise came down to the kitchen
to start up the fire. She heard the others discussing
the discharge of the cannon and mention
the damage done to the bee hive. Then she looked
around the kitchen and suddenly gave a scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My pocketbook! Where is my pocketbook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your pocketbook?&rdquo; asked Sam, who had
come around to the kitchen to wash his hands.
&ldquo;Where did you leave it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I had it on that side table. It was wrapped
in an old newspaper. I was going to take it up
to my room last night and hide it, but I forgot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That newspaper!&rdquo; ejaculated Sam, and turned
slightly pale. &ldquo;If you had it in that newspaper
it was your pocketbook that shot the top off that
bee hive!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">A DAY TO REMEMBER</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Great Cicero, is it possible we have shot the
cook&rsquo;s pocketbook to pieces!&rdquo; murmured Dick,
who had come up in time to hear the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot it! Did you shoot at my pocketbook?&rdquo;
demanded Sarah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t shoot at it, Sarah,&rdquo; answered Sam.
&ldquo;I stuffed that paper in the cannon for wadding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, with my pocketbook in it!&rdquo; screamed
the cook. &ldquo;Oh, dear! Was ever there such
boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there was anything in the paper.
It looked all crumpled up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the best paper I could find and I
thought it would do,&rdquo; groaned Sarah. &ldquo;Oh, dear,
what am I to do? Where is the pocketbook now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blown to kingdom come, I reckon,&rdquo; murmured
the youngest Rover. &ldquo;But never mind, I&rsquo;ll
buy you a new one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The pocketbook couldn&rsquo;t have been a very
large one,&rdquo; said Tom, who had come up to learn
the cause of the excitement in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;it was quite small. My sister sent
it to me from Chicago, for a birthday present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you have in it?&rdquo; asked Sam anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had four dollars in it in bills, and ten of
those new shiny cents, and a ten-cent piece, and a
sample of dress goods, and a slip of paper with a
new way on it to make grape jelly, and some pills
for the headache, and a motto verse, and&mdash;and I
don&rsquo;t know what else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; came from Tom. &ldquo;No
wonder the bees kicked at having all that fired at
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you back the money, Sarah, and get
you a new pocketbook,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully
sorry it happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look for the pocketbook,&rdquo; suggested
Dick, and this was done, the boys taking good
care, while on the search, to keep out of the
range of the bees. All they could find in the orchard
were two of the cent pieces and part of the
metal clasp of the pocketbook&mdash;the rest had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let us be thankful that we didn&rsquo;t blow
the cannon apart, or hit somebody with that
charge,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>Later the cannon was fired off with more care.
It certainly made a loud noise, and a farmer,
driving past, said he had heard it away down at
Oak Run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A feller down there told me he guessed the
quarry men were blastin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I said
&rsquo;twas a cannon. She kin go some, can&rsquo;t she!&rdquo;
And he shook his head grimly as he drove on.</p>
<p>The boys and girls spent the morning in firing
off the cannon and in shooting off some firecrackers.
Mrs. Rover served an elaborate dinner,
and had the dining room trimmed in red,
white and blue flowers in honor of the national
birthday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember how we spent last Fourth,&rdquo;
said Tom, when the meal was about over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do!&rdquo; cried Nellie. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember
that big imitation cannon cracker you
set off on the dining room table of the yacht and
how it covered all of us with confetti.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and how Hans Mueller slid under the
table in fright!&rdquo; added Dick; and then all laughed
heartily over an affair that I have already described
in detail in &ldquo;The Rover Boys on Treasure
Isle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear old Hans!&rdquo; murmured Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
first rate to see him this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us ask him to the farm for a week,&rdquo; suggested
Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we will, along with Fred Garrison,&rdquo;
answered Dick.</p>
<p>During the afternoon the boys and girls played
croquet and took a short ride in the touring car,
and had ice-cream and cake served to them under
the trees by Aleck Pop, who wore his waiter outfit
for the occasion. Then they sat around until
it was dark, and after supper the boys brought
forth the fireworks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, be careful,&rdquo; warned both their father
and their uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be!&rdquo; they cried, and set off the pieces
from a field where they could not possibly do
harm. The girls and the ladies, as well as the
men, watched proceedings with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how grand!&rdquo; cried Dora, as the rockets
curved gracefully through the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful!&rdquo; murmured Grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could look at fireworks all night!&rdquo; declared
Nellie.</p>
<p>The fireworks came to an end with a set piece
called Uncle Sam. It fizzed and flared brightly,
showing the well-known face of the old man and
the big hat. Then Tom commenced to pull a
wire and Uncle Sam took his hat off and put it
on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how cute!&rdquo; cried Grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last act!&rdquo; cried Tom, and set fire to a slow
match that was near. Presently some flower pots
commenced to send up a golden shower, and then,
from a wire between two trees there blazed forth
the words &ldquo;<i>Good Night</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that was very nice indeed!&rdquo; was Mrs.
Stanhope&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As nice an exhibition of fireworks as I ever
saw,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Laning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I say!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Rover. &ldquo;The
boys certainly know how to get up a show!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the fireworks came darkness, but neither
the boys nor the girls seemed to mind this. They
paired off, and took walks around the house and
down the roadway. Perhaps a good many silly
things were said, but, if so, there was no harm in
them. The only ones who were really serious
were Dick and Dora, and seeing this Tom nudged
Nellie in the side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like they were getting down to business,
doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he observed, dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom, hush, they might hear you!&rdquo; she
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have Dick for a cousin-in-law some
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I shan&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about having him for a brother-in-law,
Nellie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this suggestion Nellie&rsquo;s face grew crimson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Rover, you&rsquo;re the limit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how about it?&rdquo; he persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean if Sam should marry Grace?&rdquo; she
asked archly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much&mdash;although that may happen too. I
mean if you should condescend to marry such a
harum-scarum chap like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom!&rdquo; And now Nellie hid her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you don&rsquo;t like me, Nellie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Tom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know how much I like you. It&rsquo;s been
that way ever since we met on the Cedarville
steamer. I know I&rsquo;m pretty young to talk this
way, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get older, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I don&rsquo;t want any other fellow to
come around&mdash;when I&rsquo;m away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about some other girl coming around
when I&rsquo;m away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be any other girl, Nellie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; And now Nellie looked quite
in earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then&mdash;&rdquo; her voice sank very low. &ldquo;There
can&rsquo;t be any other fellow! There!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nellie!&rdquo; he cried. Then he would have caught
her in his arms, but she held him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Tom. I understand, and I am very,
very glad,&rdquo; she said, earnestly. &ldquo;But mamma&mdash;she
is a little bit old-fashioned, you know. She
made both of us&mdash;Grace and I&mdash;promise not to&mdash;to
become engaged until we were twenty or
twenty-one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;ll have to wait a little longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. But we understand each other, don&rsquo;t
we, Nellie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sure we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you are old enough&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk it over again,&rdquo; she answered, and
took his arm as if to walk back to the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said. Then of a sudden he
turned and faced her. &ldquo;And is that all?&rdquo; he
pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom, it ought to be!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Nellie!&rdquo; he pleaded, and drew her a little
closer. Then for just an instant her head went
down on his shoulder and she allowed him to kiss
her. Then they joined the others, both feeling as
if they were walking on air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>An hour later found everybody either in the
house or on the veranda. Dora sat down to the
piano and the other young folks gathered around
to sing one favorite song after another, while the
old folks listened. They sang some of the Putnam
Hall songs, and tried several that were popular
at Brill and at Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like that even better than the fireworks,&rdquo;
murmured Mrs. Stanhope, to Anderson Rover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think I do, myself, Mrs. Stanhope,&rdquo;
he answered. And then he drew his rocking-chair
a little closer to where the widow was sitting.
&ldquo;It seems to me that Dick and Dora match it off
pretty well,&rdquo; he continued, in a lower tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Rover. And Dick is a fine young
man&mdash;your sons are all fine young men. I shall
never forget what they have done for me and
for Dora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they are bright lads, if I do say it myself,&rdquo;
answered the father, proudly. &ldquo;And let
me say, too, that I think Dora is a very dear
girl. I shall be proud to take her for a daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No prouder than I shall be to take Dick for
a son, Mr. Rover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear you say that&mdash;glad that the
idea is agreeable all around,&rdquo; returned Anderson
Rover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if, some day, Nellie
and Grace married your other sons.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly. But they are rather young yet to
think of that. Dick is older, even though they
go to college together. You see, he got behind
a little at Putnam Hall because, when I was sick,
he had to attend to a lot of business for me. But
he is going ahead fast now. He came out at the
head of his class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Dora told me. Oh, he will make his mark
in the world, I am sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he does not, it will be his own fault. I
shall give him as much of an education as he desires,
and when he wishes to go into business, or
a profession, I shall furnish him with all the
money he may need. I am going to do that for all
of the boys&mdash;that is, unless the bottom should
drop out of everything and I should become
poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Rover, I trust you do not anticipate
anything of that sort!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, at present my investments are safe. But
one cannot tell what may happen. Hard times
come, banks break, railroads default on their
bonds, and a man is knocked out before he knows
it. But I don&rsquo;t look for those things to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rover, before I leave I wish to ask your
advice about that fortune we brought home from
Treasure Isle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I ought to invest the money, or
keep it intact and wait to see what that Tad Sobber
does?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should invest it, if I were you. I really can&rsquo;t
see how Sobber has any claim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you be willing to invest it for me? A
large part of it really belongs to Dora, you know.
I am not much of a business woman, and I would
be glad if you would help me in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I will help you to invest, if you wish
it,&rdquo; answered Anderson Rover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I send the money to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, But wait till I send you word. I want
to look over the various offerings in securities
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment came a call from the parlor.
The young folks wanted the old folks to come
in and join in the singing, and they complied.
As they left the piazza a form that had been
hiding behind some bushes nearby slunk away.
The form was that of Tad Sobber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought I&rsquo;d hear something if I came here,&rdquo;
muttered that individual to himself. &ldquo;Going to
turn the fortune over to old Rover to invest, eh?
Not much! not if I can get my hands on it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Tad Sobber disappeared down the
road in the darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">OFF FOR CAMP</span></h2>
<p>All too quickly for the girls and the boys, the
visit of the folks from Cedarville to Valley Brook
farm came to an end. During the week the boys
took the girls on several trips in the touring car,
and once all went for a picnic up the Swift river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must write to us often, Dick,&rdquo; said Dora,
on parting. &ldquo;If you go camping, tell us all the
particulars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly will, Dora,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;And
you let me know all about what you are doing.
And don&rsquo;t forget to urge your mother to take a
trip somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys had already written to their former
school chums and fellow travelers, Fred Garrison
and Hans Mueller, and those boys had written
back that they would arrive at the farm, with an
outfit for camping, on the following Saturday.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That will just suit!&rdquo; cried Sam. &ldquo;We can
rest up over Sunday and start for camp Monday
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m anxious to see what Hans will bring,&rdquo;
came from Tom, who was perusing a long communication
from the German American youth.
&ldquo;He seems to have the notion that this outing is
to last into cold weather, and that we are going
to hunt bears and lions and a few other wild
beasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, maybe he is only trying to be funny,&rdquo; answered
Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hans is funny without trying to be,&rdquo; put in
Dick. &ldquo;Just the same, he is one of the best boys
in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred Garrison and Hans Mueller had arranged
to arrive at Oak Run on the same train, and the
Rover boys went to meet them as they had the
folks from Cedarville, in the new touring car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here she comes!&rdquo; cried Sam, as the distant
whistle of the locomotive reached their ears.
Then the train hove in sight and they saw Fred&rsquo;s
head sticking out of one window and Hans&rsquo; head,
out of another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Fred! How are you, Hans!&rdquo; was the
cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, is this really the station?&rdquo; asked Fred,
with a grin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been watching milk depots for
the last hour.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is really and truly the metropolis of Oak
Run!&rdquo; sang out Tom. &ldquo;Move lively now, or
you&rsquo;ll be carried further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two young travelers alighted, each with
two suit-cases. In addition Fred carried a fishing
rod. Hans was loaded down with a fishing rod,
a shotgun, a big box camera, and a bundle done
up in a steamer robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Hans, did you just come across the
Atlantic?&rdquo; questioned Dick, as the boys shook
hands all around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Atlantic?&rdquo; repeated Hans Mueller. &ldquo;Not
much I didn&rsquo;t, Dick; I come from home, chust so
straight like der railroad runs alretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brought a few things along I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I did. Vy not, of ve go camping by der
voods? I got my fishing shtick, and my gun, and
a planket, and a camera to took vild animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to take their pictures first and then
slay &rsquo;em, eh?&rdquo; remarked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dot&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got your license, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;License. Vot license?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To snap-shot the lions and tigers and bears,
Hans. It costs two dollars and ten cents to snap-shot
a bear now, and lions and tigers are a dollar
and forty-five.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Vot?&rdquo; gasped the German boy. &ldquo;Do da make
you bay to took pictures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, didn&rsquo;t you know that? I thought you
read the new patent and copyright laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I got somet&rsquo;ing else to do, Dom. By
chiminy! Of da charge so much as dot I ton&rsquo;t
took no bictures, not much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe we can fix it so you won&rsquo;t have
to pay any license,&rdquo; returned Tom, calmly. &ldquo;But
jump in&mdash;dinner is waiting for us at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what a dandy car!&rdquo; cried Fred. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been anxious to see it ever since you wrote about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us all about dear old Putnam Hall,&rdquo; said
Sam to Hans, when the crowd were on the way
to the farm, and the German boy told them all
the news. Then Fred told about himself, and
how he was thinking of going into business with
his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to camp?&rdquo; asked Fred,
just before the farm was reached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought of going up the Swift river,&rdquo; said
Dick. &ldquo;But maybe we&rsquo;ll go over to Lake Nasco.
There is a fine spot up there for camping, and we
can have the use of a small sailboat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be fine, Dick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk it over tonight&mdash;after you have
had supper.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>Fred and Hans had been at the farm before
and the old folks greeted them warmly. As usual,
Mrs. Rover had a substantial meal prepared, and
it did her good to see how both Hans and Fred
relished the things provided. The German youth
especially had a good appetite, and he stowed
away so much it looked as if he would burst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, we&rsquo;ll have to take along lots to eat,&rdquo;
whispered Sam to Dick. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t, Hans will
clean us out in no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll take all we need,&rdquo; answered the
big brother.</p>
<p>After supper the five lads talked over the plans
for camping out, and it was finally decided that
they should journey up the Swift River to Lake
Nasco. They were to remain in camp for a week
or ten days, and possibly two weeks.</p>
<p>As my old readers know, the Swift River could
not be navigated around the Falls&mdash;those awful
falls where the boys had once had such a harrowing
experience. But further up, the watercourse
was fairly deep and smooth, and from that point
the boys decided to take the small sailboat and
either sail or row to the lake, two miles further
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll drive to the boat landing with the farm
wagon,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Jack Ness can take us, and
bring the wagon back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>On Sunday the entire family went to the village
church and the visitors accompanied them.
In the afternoon the boys inspected their outfits
and took it easy. Fred and Hans sent letters
home, stating they had arrived safely, and the
Rovers sent letters to Cedarville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hans, while you are in camp, don&rsquo;t forget to
take a picture of the Pluibuscus,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t charge to take those.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vot is dot?&rdquo; asked Hans innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, didn&rsquo;t you ever see a Pluibuscus!&rdquo; demanded
Tom, in astonishment. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sort of a
Cantonoko, only larger. They live in holes, like
bears, only they have four wings, located between
the sixth and the seventh legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine cracious, Dom, vot you talkin&rsquo; apout,
ennavay?&rdquo; demanded the German boy. &ldquo;I ton&rsquo;t
know no animals vot got legs and vings alretty.
Vos da very pig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they are not pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vot? I tidn&rsquo;t say pig. I say vos da pig&mdash;pig&mdash;pig.
Ton&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I understand. They are not pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dot ain&rsquo;t it at all. I say vos da pig&mdash;so pig or
so pig?&rdquo; And the German boy put out his hands,
first close together and then wide apart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean large?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah, dot&rsquo;s him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they are about the size of a horse, that
is, when they are young. As they grow older they
get smaller, so that an old Pluibuscus is about the
size of a dog. But it&rsquo;s the horns you have to look
out for. They are pointed like daggers and very
poisonous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Du meine zeit!</i> Den I ton&rsquo;t vont to meet none
of dose Pluricustibusters, or vot you call dem,&rdquo;
and Hans shook his head, decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you see one I advise you to run,&rdquo; put in
Sam, who was enjoying the fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run? You bet my life I run!&rdquo; cried Hans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best way to get away is to run into the
water,&rdquo; went on Tom. &ldquo;They hate the water.
Just run into the lake and duck down and keep
hidden for five or ten minutes and the Pluibuscus
will walk away in disgust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How vos I going to keep mine head under
der vater fife oder den minutes?&rdquo; questioned
Hans, in perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, take a deep breath,&rdquo; suggested Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do him so long as dot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poke a hole in the water to breathe through,&rdquo;
suggested Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I guess you vos making fun!&rdquo; cried
Hans, suspiciously. &ldquo;Maybe dare ain&rsquo;t no Pluicusisduster
at all. Dot&rsquo;s&mdash;vot you call him?&mdash;Yah!
He is a fish story!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tom, you&rsquo;re discovered!&rdquo; screamed Sam, and
then there was a roar of laughter. Hans looked
a bit sheepish, but took the fun in good part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put I get square, see of I ton&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he said,
shaking his finger at Tom.</p>
<p>Sunday evening there was a light shower and
the boys were much worried, thinking it might
keep on raining. But the shower passed by morning
and the sun came out bright and clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now ho! for camp!&rdquo; cried Sam &ldquo;Come
on, the sooner we start the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An early breakfast was procured, and the camping
outfit, consisting of the tent, their fishing and
hunting outfits, blankets and extra clothing, and
a quantity of food, canned and otherwise, was
loaded on the big farm wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready, so far as I can see,&rdquo; answered Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vait! vait!&rdquo; cried Hans, &ldquo;I got to get mine
ear coferings!&rdquo; And he ran back into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ear coverings?&rdquo; queried Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Fred, with a smile. &ldquo;His
mother made him a pair of coverings of mosquito
netting, so that ants or other insects couldn&rsquo;t
crawl into his ears while he was sleeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not such a bad idea,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;But he
needed them more in the West Indies than he&rsquo;ll
need them here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Soon Hans appeared with his ear coverings,
and then the lads said good-bye. The whip
cracked, and they were off on their outing. Little
did they dream of how the holidays were to come
to an abrupt end.</p>
<p>The road along the river was a rather rough
one and they had to proceed slowly, for fear of
jouncing off part of the load. But the lads were
in the best of spirits and as they rode along they
sang and cracked jokes to their hearts&rsquo; content.
Tom had the last of his &ldquo;doctored&rdquo; cigars with
him and he passed this over to Jack Ness, and
all had a hearty laugh when the hired man lit
up and was treated to a dose of the &ldquo;worms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gum! I might have remembered about
them cigars!&rdquo; murmured the wagon driver. &ldquo;I
laffed at Ricks an&rsquo; now you got the same laff
on me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Jack, you buy something worth
smoking, when you go to town,&rdquo; said Tom, and
slyly slipped a silver quarter into the hired man&rsquo;s
palm.</p>
<p>It was noon-time when they reached the spot
where they could get the sailboat. This was hired
from a man living in the vicinity, and that individual&rsquo;s
wife supplied all hands with dinner, for
the boys did not want to touch their stores until
necessary. Then the sailboat was loaded and the
boys got on board.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to row,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t
breeze enough to do any good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, rowing suits me,&rdquo; cried Sam, and caught
up an oar and Tom did the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll spell you after a bit,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;It is
not fair to let you do all the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So will I,&rdquo; added Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah, and me,&rdquo; nodded Hans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Jack!&rdquo; cried all, and waved their
hands to the hired man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the folks not to worry&mdash;that we will be
all right,&rdquo; added Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a good time!&rdquo; answered Jack Ness.
Then Sam and Tom started to row, and slowly
the boat moved in the direction of Lake Nasco.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">HANS MUELLER&rsquo;S QUEER CATCH</span></h2>
<p>Lake Nasco was an irregular sheet of water,
about three miles long by a quarter of a mile
wide. It was not very deep, excepting at one
spot near the upper end. In the center were several
islands, known locally as the Cat and Kittens.</p>
<p>The spot the Rover boys had in mind for their
camp was located near the upper shore, where a
series of rocks ran out to the deep water. Here
would be a good place for the sailboat, and here
the fishing would be good and also the swimming.</p>
<p>The whole crowd took turns at rowing, and
when the lake was reached Sam and Hans got
out their fishing outfits and started to troll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I can catch anything, but if
I am successful, we can have fried fish for supper,&rdquo;
said Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yum! yum! that would just suit me!&rdquo; cried
Fred. &ldquo;Fish just caught are so much better than
those from the store.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>It was not long before Sam felt a tug on his
line. He hauled in quickly and found a fair-sized
perch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! first luck!&rdquo; he cried, his face beaming
with pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! dot ain&rsquo;t mooch of a fish!&rdquo; was Han&rsquo;s
comment. &ldquo;Chust vait till you see vot I cotch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They continued to troll, and presently Sam
hooked a medium-sized pickerel. The fish was
game and he had to play it a little before Dick
was able to bring it in with the net.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I guess we had better all try our luck,&rdquo;
said Tom. &ldquo;This sport suits me down to the
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Tom, let us get to camp,&rdquo; replied his elder
brother. &ldquo;Remember, we have got to cut poles
for the tent and cut firewood, and do a lot of
things before we go to bed. You can fish all
you please tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boat moved on and soon Hans got a bite.
It was another perch, about the size of the one
caught by Sam. Then Sam got another, but of
a different stripe.</p>
<p>Suddenly Hans&rsquo; line tightened and the German
youth stood up in his excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vait! I got a pite!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Say, dot is a
pig feller I guess!&rdquo; he added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>They stopped in their rowing and watched
Hans try to land his catch. He tugged on the
line, which grew taut and threatened to snap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play him a little, Hans,&rdquo; suggested Dick. And
the line was let out cautiously. Then Hans commenced
to reel in once more. Slowly but surely
his catch came closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you got, Hans, a maskalonge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a whale!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a water snake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cracious, vos der vater snakes here?&rdquo; questioned
the German boy, turning slightly pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure there are,&rdquo; answered Tom, readily.
&ldquo;Some of &rsquo;em are fifteen and twenty feet long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dom, you vos choking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not choking,&rdquo; answered Tom. &ldquo;My
breath is regular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know vot I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pull in the catch!&rdquo; cried Fred, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; added Sam. &ldquo;Say, Hans,
you&rsquo;ve got something big that&rsquo;s sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly but steadily the German youth reeled in,
until his bait was within a few feet of the boat.
Then from the water came something long and
dark and slimy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a water snake!&rdquo; yelled Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my! safe me, somepody!&rdquo; screamed
Hans, and fell back in fright and came close to
falling overboard. &ldquo;Cut der line! Ton&rsquo;t let him
pite me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no snake!&rdquo; said Sam, quickly. &ldquo;But what
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon know,&rdquo; answered Dick, and pulled
in on the line a little more. Then the object
came alongside the boat and the boys set up a
shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A piece of old rope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a knot for a snake&rsquo;s head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a rock at the other end. This must have
been used by somebody for an anchor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, vos you sure dot ain&rsquo;t no vater snake?&rdquo;
asked Hans, timidly. He had crawled to the bow
of the boat, as far from the line as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See for yourself, Hans,&rdquo; answered Dick.</p>
<p>Hans went forward cautiously and his eyes
opened in wonder. Then a sickly grin spread
over his round face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! Dot&rsquo;s a fine fish, ain&rsquo;t he? Say, Sam,
vos you goin&rsquo; to fry him in putter oder in lard
alretty?&rdquo; And at this quaint query all the other
boys set up a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;d better give up fishing now,&rdquo; said
Dick, after the merriment was over. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
enough for supper, and the best thing we can
do is to reach the end of the lake and fix up our
camp for the night. We want everything in
first-class shape, so that if a storm comes our
things won&rsquo;t get soaked.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say storm!&rdquo; cried Fred. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to see rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are bound to get some, Fred, sooner or
later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fishing outfits were put away, and once
more the boat moved over the bosom of the
lake. They had passed three other boats and saw
one camp on the north shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope we find the Point deserted,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; answered Tom. &ldquo;We want to camp
all by ourselves this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not long before they came in sight of
the shore and the rocky Point. Not a soul was
in sight. They brought the boat around to a
little cove and all leaped ashore. Near at hand
was the remains of a campfire, but it looked a
week or more old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody here,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an ideal spot for camping!&rdquo; was Fred&rsquo;s
comment, as he gazed around. And he was right.
The shore sloped gently down to the water&rsquo;s edge,
and was backed up by a patch of woods. Among
the trees were some rocks, and between them a
spring of clear, cold water. Not far off was the
cove, where the sailboat could be tied up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the first thing to do?&rdquo; questioned
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut poles for the tent, and also cut some firewood,&rdquo;
answered Dick. &ldquo;Bring out the hatchets,
fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two hatchets had been brought along, and all
hands were soon at work, getting the camp into
shape and starting a fire. Dick selected the poles
for the tent and cut them down and trimmed
them. Fred built the fire, and Sam cleaned the
fish. Then everybody took a hand at raising the
tent and fastening it down tightly with pegs. A
trench was dug at the rear of the canvas covering,
so that if it rained the water would run off
towards the lake. The tent was a large one, and
in the rear they stored their extra clothing and
food. Then they cut down boughs for bedding
and got out their blankets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water is boiling,&rdquo; announced Fred, who
had put a kettle on some sticks over the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now the tent is fixed, we&rsquo;ll have supper,&rdquo;
said Dick, who had been made leader. &ldquo;I reckon
we are all hungry enough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="front">
<img src="images/front.jpg" alt="&ldquo;WELL, NOW THE TENT IS FIXED, WE&rsquo;LL HAVE SUPPER,&rdquo; SAID DICK." width="500" height="781" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;WELL, NOW THE TENT IS FIXED, WE&rsquo;LL HAVE SUPPER,&rdquo; SAID DICK.</span></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know I am,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dink I could eat a leetle,&rdquo; said Hans, winking
one eye laboriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want a piece of fried water snake, Hans?&rdquo;
asked Tom, dryly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dom, I dake a steak from dot Pluibusterduster,&rdquo;
answered the German youth, with a
grin.</p>
<p>Sam knew how to fry fish to perfection, and
soon an appetizing odor filled the air. Fred made
the coffee, and boiled some potatoes. They had
brought along some fresh bread and cut slices
from one of the loaves. They also had a few
cookies, made by Mrs. Rover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this is the best fish I ever tasted!&rdquo; cried
Dick, when they were eating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I say!&rdquo; added Fred. &ldquo;Sam, if you don&rsquo;t
mind, I&rsquo;ll take another piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fresh air that tunes up a fellow&rsquo;s appetite,&rdquo;
remarked Tom. &ldquo;Stay out a month and
you&rsquo;ll want to eat like a horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing the matter with my appetite at any
time,&rdquo; murmured Sam. &ldquo;Oh, Hans, what&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo; he demanded, as he saw the German lad
throw his head into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s choking!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick, leaping up in
alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it vo&mdash;vos ch&mdash;chust a fi&mdash;fish pone!&rdquo;
gasped Hans. &ldquo;He got in mine neck sidevays alretty!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better be careful after this,&rdquo; cautioned Dick.
&ldquo;Here, swallow a piece of dry bread. That will
help to carry it down.&rdquo; And it did, and then
Hans felt better.</p>
<p>As night came on the boys prepared their beds
and then gathered around the campfire and talked,
and told stories. All were in the best of humor,
and they talked of their old schooldays at Putnam
Hall, and of the jokes played on the other
boys, and on Josiah Crabtree, and on Peleg Snuggers,
the general utility man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those were certainly great days,&rdquo; said Fred,
almost sadly. &ldquo;I wish they could come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got to look ahead, not backwards,&rdquo;
answered Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How some of the fellows have changed,&rdquo; went
on Fred. &ldquo;Just think of what a bully Dan Baxter
used to be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and now he is a real good fellow, and
doing well as a commercial traveler,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad that Tad Sobber can&rsquo;t turn over a
new leaf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he will, some day,&rdquo; came from Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it is in him,&rdquo; answered Dick.
&ldquo;He is not like Dan Baxter was. Dan got awfully
hot-headed at times, but Sobber is a regular knave&mdash;one
of the oily, sneaking kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen him since his injunction
against the Stanhopes was dismissed in court?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I have heard from him, Fred. He is
after that fortune, still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can he do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know. But he is bound to make
trouble, some way or other. It makes me sick to
think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us talk about something else,&rdquo; said
Tom; and then the lads branched off into a discussion
of how the days to come were to be
spent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any big game left around here?&rdquo; asked Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of, Fred. And you couldn&rsquo;t
shoot it anyway&mdash;it is out of season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can get some rabbits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t of much account this time of
year&mdash;and they are out of season, too. We&rsquo;ll
have to depend mostly on fishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock before they turned in.
Then Sam was so sleepy he could hardly keep
his eyes open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody going to stay on guard?&rdquo; asked
Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it is necessary,&rdquo; answered Tom.
&ldquo;Nobody will disturb us up there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>The fire was allowed to die down, so that it
might not set fire to any surrounding objects, and
one after another the boys turned in. Hans was
soon snoring, and presently Fred, Dick and Sam
dropped asleep. For some reason Tom could not
compose himself, and he turned restlessly from
side to side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I must have eaten too hearty a supper,&rdquo;
he murmured to himself. But at last he dozed
off, to dream of college and a rousing game on
the baseball field.</p>
<p>Dick slept for about an hour. Then, of a sudden,
he awoke with a start. He felt a pain in his
ankle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he murmured
and sat up. As he did so a weird groan reached
his ears. He listened intently, and soon the groan
was repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he asked aloud. But no
answer came to his question. Then came another
groan, and now thoroughly alarmed, Dick leaped
to his feet in the darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">THE HAPPENINGS OF A NIGHT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Sam who asked the question. Dick&rsquo;s
question had aroused him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What woke you up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt something on my ankle&mdash;and then I
heard several groans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vos somepody call me?&rdquo; asked Hans, sleepily.
&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t pe morning yet, it&rsquo;s too dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t call you, Hans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, what is it?&rdquo; And now Fred roused
up. &ldquo;What is going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Sam, who had
been sleeping behind him. &ldquo;We are trying to
find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick had gone to a post of the tent. Here a
box of matches had been placed in a holder and
he took one out, struck it, and held it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Tom is gone!&rdquo; he cried, seeing that the
place his brother had occupied was vacant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So he is!&rdquo; murmured Sam. He raised his
voice: &ldquo;Tom! Tom! where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no reply to this call, and all in the
tent gazed at each other questioningly. Then the
match went out, leaving them in darkness as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this,&rdquo; muttered Dick, and he
made his way outside, followed by the others.
Fred had loaded a shotgun and he caught up the
piece. Hans walked to the smouldering fire and
threw on some dry brushwood which soon caused
a glare.</p>
<p>All looked around the tent, but failed to catch
sight of Tom. Then they hurried to the edge of
the lake, but nobody was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom! I say Tom!&rdquo; yelled Sam. &ldquo;Where
are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All listened, but no reply came back. But they
heard a curious noise at a distance up the lake
shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he is in trouble!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;Spread
out and look for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the boys ran up the shore and one
down, and Fred and Hans walked towards the
woods, the former carrying the shotgun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you dink a&mdash;a bear cotched him?&rdquo; asked
the German youth, in a tragic whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think,&rdquo; answered Fred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>Dick had gone up the shore, where the rocks
were rather rough. As he came out on the point
he heard a peculiar noise and then a yell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A home run! A home run!&rdquo; reached his
ears. &ldquo;Everybody in the game!&rdquo; And then, to
his utter amazement, Tom appeared, running in
a queer fashion. He was headed directly for the
lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s asleep! He&rsquo;s got a nightmare!&rdquo; thought
Dick, and as Tom attempted to pass him he caught
his brother by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go&mdash;I want to reach home plate!&rdquo; growled
the sleepwalker, and tried to break away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom! Tom! wake up!&rdquo; cried Dick, and retaining
a firm grip on his brother&rsquo;s arm he shook
him vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; groaned Tom at last. &ldquo;I&mdash;what&mdash;stop
shaking me!&rdquo; he added, in confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Tom! Wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I am awake! What are you shaking
me for?&rdquo; demanded the fun-loving Rover.
He could see no fun in the present proceedings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom, you&rsquo;ve been walking in your sleep,&rdquo;
said Dick. He raised his voice. &ldquo;This way,
fellows; I&rsquo;ve found him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; and Sam came running, followed
by Fred and Hans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have I&mdash;er&mdash;really been walking in my
sleep?&rdquo; asked Tom, sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t this look like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, where am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up the lake shore. We missed you and hurried
out to find you. You were just going to run
into the lake when I grabbed you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he really walking in his sleep?&rdquo; asked
Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, unless he was shamming,&rdquo; answered his
elder brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t shamming,&rdquo; stammered poor Tom.
&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I was dreaming about a ball game, and
I was&mdash;er&mdash;trying to make a home run! Say,
this is punky, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he added, staring at the
crowd, blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing Dick came up in time,&rdquo; said
Sam. &ldquo;Supposing you had run into the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess the bath would have woke him
up,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;But I am mighty glad I stopped
him,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not more glad than I am,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;I guess I ate too much supper. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep
at all at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you had better chain yourself fast in
the tent after this,&rdquo; remarked Fred. &ldquo;Dick, it
was lucky you woke up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Something pressed me on the ankle. It&rsquo;s a
little sore yet. I guess Tom stepped on it when
he left the tent&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t wake up fast enough
to catch him then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All walked back to the tent and sat down
around the campfire to talk the matter over. But
nothing new was learned and presently they retired
again; and this time all slept soundly until
morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First in the lake for a morning plunge!&rdquo;
shouted Sam, as he rushed out. &ldquo;Come on, everybody,
it will wake you up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you, Sam!&rdquo; answered Fred, and side
by side the pair ran down to the water and
plunged in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew! as cold as Greenland!&rdquo; spluttered Fred,
as he came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the first plunge,&rdquo; answered the youngest
Rover. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon get used to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others followed, Hans being the last to go
in. The German youth was on the point of backing
out, as the water looked so cold, when Sam
came up behind him and sent him in with a rush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! wow!&rdquo; spluttered Hans. &ldquo;Say, maype
dot ain&rsquo;t cold, py chiminy! I vos dink I fell into
an ice-house alretty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swim around and you&rsquo;ll soon get warm,&rdquo; was
Dick&rsquo;s advice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>The boys remained in the water less than ten
minutes and then lost no time in dressing. Then
came a hot breakfast, to which all paid every attention.</p>
<p>It had been decided that they should spend the
day in fishing and in resting up, so they took it
easy. Some went out in the boat and took a
short sail, for a fair breeze was blowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This puts me in mind of the times we used to
camp out with the Putnam Hall cadets,&rdquo; remarked
Tom. &ldquo;Only there used to be more of a
crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For dinner they had more fish, and also some
beans which had been brought along. They also
made a pot of chocolate&mdash;something that suited
Hans especially&mdash;and the cookies were not forgotten.</p>
<p>Two days passed, and the boys enjoyed every
minute of the time. They took a tramp through
the woods back of the camp and found a blackberry
patch where the luscious fruit was growing
in profusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take all we can carry back to camp with
us!&rdquo; cried Sam, and this was done, and then the
youngest Rover took it upon his shoulders to
make a huckleberry roly-poly pudding, &ldquo;just like
Aunt Martha&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Perhaps the pudding was not
as good as those turned out by Mrs. Rover, but
it was good enough, and the boys ate it to the last
scrap. Then Fred tried his hand one morning at
flapjacks and these they also ate with a relish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I dink I makes you some Cherman coffee cake
alretty,&rdquo; said Hans, on the day following, and in
the afternoon he set to work. Soon he had several
kettles, pans and pails filled with flour and water
and other things. His hands were full of a pasty
mess, and he had some of the stuff on his nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you getting on?&rdquo; asked Dick, when
he saw the German youth stop and stare around
in perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dink I need anudder dish,&rdquo; said Hans,
slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott, Hans! You now have about all
in the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is dot so! Vell, I must but dis stuff someveres,
ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; And Hans proceeded to dump
the mass in one bowl with that in another. The
other lads watched him work with keen interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want more sugar, Hans?&rdquo; asked Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about salt?&rdquo; questioned Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you want a little more flour?&rdquo; came
from Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to flavor it with peppermint?&rdquo; asked
Tom. &ldquo;I saw a lot of the stuff growing back of
the spring.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You chust leave me alone!&rdquo; cried Hans.
&ldquo;Ton&rsquo;t you podder me, oder I makes some mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he has made several mistakes already,&rdquo;
whispered Dick to Fred, as they turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. But wait and see what he
turns out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all waited and watched Hans from a distance.
The poor German youth worked hard for
two hours, baking his stuff over the roaring fire.
His face was flushed and he looked far from
happy. At last he declared that his coffee cake
must be done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly looks like coffee,&rdquo; said Tom, as
he gazed at the mass, which was shaped like a
flower pot and was the color of roasted coffee
beans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Hans, cut it up and let us try it!&rdquo;
cried Fred, cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, you cut him up,&rdquo; answered Hans, rather
faintly.</p>
<p>Dick took the carving knife and set to work.
The knife went into the &ldquo;cake&rdquo; with ease, but
there it stuck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Dick?&rdquo; asked Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;the knife is stuck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better let me cut it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead and try your luck, Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>The youngest Rover came around and took
hold of the knife. He tried to draw the blade
free but merely succeeded in raising the &ldquo;cake&rdquo;
into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, it sticketh closer than a brother!&rdquo; exclaimed
Tom. &ldquo;Hans, did you put a porous
plaster in that cake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much I tidn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; snapped the German lad.
&ldquo;Here, you gif me dot cake! I cut him ub for
you, so quick like neffer vas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very valiantly Hans took the &ldquo;cake&rdquo; and the
knife and set to work. He had no more success
than had Dick and Sam. Finally, in a rage, he
lifted knife and &ldquo;cake&rdquo; on high and brought them
down on a stone with a bang. The &ldquo;cake&rdquo;
bounced back like a rubber ball and all but struck
him in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Hans has been manufacturing a football!&rdquo;
cried Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vot&rsquo;s der madder mit dot ennahow!&rdquo; roared
the German youth. &ldquo;I make him chust like mine
mudder make him in der old country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hans, did you make the coffee cake with
glue?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ton&rsquo;t know how I make him!&rdquo; groaned poor
Hans. &ldquo;I got me all mixed up, mit eferybody
around me! Say, can&rsquo;t you vos got dot knife
owid somehow?&rdquo; he questioned anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try a new way,&rdquo; said Dick, and placed the
&ldquo;cake&rdquo; under his feet. Then he drew on the
knife, and it came up between his feet with a sucking
sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you can sell that coffee cake for rubber,&rdquo;
said Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want a slice, Sam?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not today, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dink I drow him into der vater!&rdquo; cried Hans,
and picked up the glue-like mass. Then he ran
down to the lake front and balanced it on one of
his hands. He gave a throw, but the &ldquo;cake&rdquo; did
not land in the water as he had intended. Instead
it remained stuck to his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t get rid of it so easily!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;Be
careful, Hans, or that cake will be the death of
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Du meine zeit!</i>&rdquo; groaned the German youth,
and then he pulled at the mass until he had it free
from his fingers. Then he gave it a kick with his
foot, and it went into the lake with a splash.</p>
<p>And that was the first and last time Hans tried
to make German coffee cake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">STRANGE NEWS</span></h2>
<p>Several days passed and during that time the
lads amused themselves hugely, hunting, fishing,
swimming and knocking around generally. Once
they had a snake scare. The reptile got in the
tent and held possession for nearly an hour,
when Dick dislodged it with a stick and Sam
ended its life with a stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I ton&rsquo;t like dot!&rdquo; cried Hans, when the
excitement was at an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe any of us do,&rdquo; answered Dick,
dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be almost afraid to sleep in the tent tonight,&rdquo;
added Fred, with a shiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess there was only one snake,&rdquo; said Sam.
&ldquo;But we can look around for more.&rdquo;
Which they did, in as thorough a manner as possible.
But no more reptiles were brought to light.</p>
<p>On Saturday it rained and the rain kept up all
day Sunday. This was not so nice, and the
boys remained under shelter most of the time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I am a fair-weather camper,&rdquo; observed
Fred. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s have a song!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;And
then each fellow can tell a story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then we can play a little music,&rdquo; added
Sam. He had brought along a mouth harmonica,
and Hans had a jews-harp.</p>
<p>Sunday evening it began to clear, and by midnight
the stars were shining brightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weather will be all right by tomorrow,&rdquo;
said Dick, who had been out to look around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the woods will be wet,&rdquo; grumbled Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, let us go out in the boat. I&rsquo;d
like to explore the creek running in from the
other shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will suit me, Dick. Maybe we can get
an extra lot of nice fish over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of the boys slept soundly and it was nearly
eight o&rsquo;clock when they commenced to get breakfast,
and it was almost ten before they were
ready to start in the sailboat for the other shore
of the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, here comes a boat!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick,
as he looked down Lake Nasco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two men in it,&rdquo; added Tom. &ldquo;They seem
to be in a hurry, too, by the way the fellow at the
oars is rowing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Jack Ness in the back of the boat!&rdquo;
exclaimed Sam, as the craft drew closer. &ldquo;That
is Pete Hawley rowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack must have a message,&rdquo; came from Dick.
&ldquo;Wonder what it can be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, boys!&rdquo; yelled the Rovers&rsquo; hired man, as
soon as he was within hailing distance. &ldquo;Got a
very particular letter fer you!&rdquo; And he waved
the communication in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Jack?&rdquo; demanded Dick, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You jess read the letter, and you&rsquo;ll find out
as quick as I kin tell you,&rdquo; answered the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody sick or hurt?&rdquo; asked Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobuddy hurt&mdash;leas&rsquo;wise not in body, an&rsquo; nobuddy
sick nuther, in the ordinary way. But I
reckon your friends from Cedarville is putty sick
all the way through, when they think of their
loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick snatched the letter and glanced at it. It
was in his father&rsquo;s handwriting and bore only a
few lines, as follows:</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Just received a telegram from Mrs. Stanhope,
wanting to know if I had received her money, as
asked for? Telegraphed back that I had not
asked for money and had received none. Then
she telegraphed that she had sent money to a certain
place at my request. I don&rsquo;t understand this
at all. I fear something is wrong, and I am
going to Cedarville without delay. Better come
home and wait to hear from me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Mrs. Stanhope&rsquo;s money?&rdquo; mused Dick, as he
handed the letter to his brothers. &ldquo;Can she mean
the fortune from Treasure Isle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than likely,&rdquo; answered Tom. &ldquo;Before
we came away father told me she has said something
about investing it through him. He was to
let her know when he wanted the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he says in this letter that he didn&rsquo;t send
for the money,&rdquo; put in Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the money had been obtained under false
pretenses I guess it is Sobber&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; murmured
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than likely,&rdquo; returned Tom. &ldquo;Oh, this
is the worst yet&mdash;and just when we were getting
ready to enjoy ourselves, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have to go back, Tom. Father
may need us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we&rsquo;ll go back. I couldn&rsquo;t stay here and
enjoy myself while I knew that fortune was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad on you fellows,&rdquo; said Dick, turning
to Fred and Hans. &ldquo;But you can see how
it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; answered Fred quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I dink I got enough of camping owid annaway,&rdquo;
came from the German youth. &ldquo;Maype of
we stay here much longer von of dem snakes
comes and eats us up alretty, ain&rsquo;t it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The telegrams came yesterday, but I waited
until this morning to come here,&rdquo; said Jack Ness.
&ldquo;Your father left for Cedarville on the first train
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pack right up and get back,&rdquo; answered
Dick.</p>
<p>Although he tried not to show it, he was greatly
excited. He was sure that the Stanhope fortune
had in some manner fallen into the hands
of Tad Sobber, and he wondered if that rascal
would be able to get away with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he does it will be a sad blow to both the
Stanhopes and the Lanings,&rdquo; he said to his brothers.
&ldquo;They were planning to get much good out
of that money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be especially hard on the Lanings,&rdquo;
said Tom, soberly. &ldquo;For they are not as wealthy
as the Stanhopes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of the boys worked with a will, and Jack
Ness and the man who had rowed him to camp
aided as much as they could. As a consequence
in less than an hour the tent was down and
packed, and the rest of the camping outfit placed
aboard the sailboat. Then the journey for home
was begun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>The wind was in their favor, so those in the
little sailboat had to do little rowing, and they
helped the other boat along. Arriving at the
landing on Swift River, they found the farm
wagon awaiting them and also a carriage with the
best team of horses the Rover farm afforded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought you young gentlemen would like to
go back that way,&rdquo; explained Jack Ness. &ldquo;I
can drive slower with the wagon. I would have
brought the auto, only I can&rsquo;t manage that yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you thought of the carriage,&rdquo; answered
Dick. &ldquo;Now we can go home in jig time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys entered the carriage, and Dick took
the reins and touched up the horses. Away went
the spirited team on a gallop, the turnout bouncing
from side to side over the rocky road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine cracious!&rdquo; gasped Hans, as he tried to
hold himself down. &ldquo;Look owid, Tick, oder we
go overpoard alretty yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d rather ride home with Jack,&rdquo;
suggested Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of you can stand him, so can I,&rdquo; answered
the German youth, firmly.</p>
<p>Away they went for the Rover farm, up hill
and down. Soon they left the river road and then
struck a highway where going was much better.
Here Dick made the team do their best, and poor
Hans was badly scared, thinking the horses were
running away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of you can&rsquo;t sthop &rsquo;em, ve vos all busted up,
so quick like neffer vos!&rdquo; he bawled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all right, Hans,&rdquo; answered Sam.
&ldquo;Let Dick alone, he knows how to handle &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t da running avay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, of you say so,&rdquo; returned Hans, but
his face indicated that he thought otherwise.</p>
<p>At last they came in sight of the farm, and
drove up to the house by the back way. Their
Aunt Martha saw them coming, and ran out to
meet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any more news from the Stanhopes?&rdquo; asked
Dick, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of,&rdquo; was Mrs. Rover&rsquo;s answer.
&ldquo;Your uncle has gone off to the telegraph
office to wait for word from your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think father has reached Cedarville
yet,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>
<p>The team was turned over to Aleck Pop and
the boys went into the house. There the Rovers
read the telegrams which had been received from
Mrs. Stanhope. There was also a telegram from
John Laning, in which he said he would look into
the matter if he could get around, but that he
had fallen from the hayloft of his barn and
sprained his ankle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That will keep him home,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Too
bad&mdash;just when the Stanhopes may need his aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew the particulars of the affair&mdash;then
a fellow would know how to act,&rdquo; said Dick,
impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father may send word before night,&rdquo; answered
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sorry to see your father go away,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Rover. &ldquo;He was not very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not well?&rdquo; cried Sam. &ldquo;What was the matter
with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t much, but it was enough. You&rsquo;ll
remember how he struck his knee on a rock or
something, while you were on that treasure hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, he fell down in the hole,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;He was so excited at the time he didn&rsquo;t notice
the hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, Tom. Well, lately that has bothered
him quite some, and he had to go to a doctor
about it. The doctor told him to be careful of
the knee, or it might give him lots of trouble and
maybe get stiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he shouldn&rsquo;t have gone to Cedarville,&rdquo;
said Dick. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want dad to get a stiff leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, do you know what?&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;I
think we ought to got to Cedarville ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; cried Sam. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do
anything here but suck our thumbs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait until morning and see if any word
comes,&rdquo; answered Dick, who did not want to do
anything hastily. &ldquo;Perhaps father may want us
to work on the case from this end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Fred and Hans?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll go along&mdash;part of the way,&rdquo; answered
Sam. &ldquo;They said they would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad to break up their vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they understand matters. And, besides,
they are both going elsewhere next week,&rdquo; answered
Tom.</p>
<p>Impatiently the three Rovers waited for news
from their father or from the Stanhopes. At
supper time Mr. Randolph Rover returned from
Oak Run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a telegram from your father, stating
he arrived safely at Cedarville,&rdquo; said the boys&rsquo;
uncle. &ldquo;We ought to get some word late tonight
about this mysterious affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later Tom was outside, walking around
the piazza. He was looking on the ground, and
presently saw something bright lying at the foot
of a bush, and stooped to pick it up. It was a
queer-shaped stone, of blue and white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen that stone before,&rdquo; he murmured, as
he turned it over in his hand. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t belong
to any of our folks. Maybe it is Fred&rsquo;s, or
Hans&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>With his find in his hand he entered the house,
where the others were just sitting down to the
table to eat. He held the stone up to view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any of you lose this?&rdquo; he asked, and looked
at Fred and Hans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dot ain&rsquo;t vos mine,&rdquo; declared Hans, readily.
&ldquo;Vot vos it, a stone from a preastbin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it is from a watch locket,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>Fred looked at the stone and started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see it!&rdquo; he cried, and held it close to
the light. &ldquo;Well, I declare!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about it, Fred?&rdquo; asked Dick and Sam,
in a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who this stone belongs to, but
I do know that Tad Sobber used to wear one just
like it, when he went to Putnam Hall!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">SOMETHING OF A CLUE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Tad Sobber!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cry came simultaneously from all of the
Rover boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah, dot&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; exclaimed Hans. &ldquo;I remember
him now. Vonce I vos ask Sobber vere he
got dot sthone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the stone belongs to Sobber&mdash;he must have
been here!&rdquo; gasped out Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he is around now?&rdquo; asked Tom,
and threw his eyes about the lawn, as if half
expecting their enemy to show himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t here now&mdash;wish he was,&rdquo; answered
Dick, bitterly. &ldquo;More than likely he is
miles away by this time&mdash;and the Stanhope fortune
with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand this,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;Unless
Sobber has been here, spying on you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he followed the Stanhopes here&mdash;to
find out, if he could, what had become of the fortune,&rdquo;
suggested Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam, I think you&rsquo;ve struck it!&rdquo; almost shouted
Dick. &ldquo;It may be that he came here, heard Mrs.
Stanhope ask dad to invest the money for her, and
heard dad say that he would let her know when
he wanted the cash. Then, perhaps, he went off,
and sent Mrs. Stanhope a bogus letter, or telegram,
signing dad&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Dick, you&rsquo;re a regular sleuth!&rdquo; cried
Fred. &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ve got it straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys entered the house, and there told their
uncle and aunt of what had been found. Randolph
Rover looked at the stone with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a curious one,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I do
not imagine there are many like it. If this Sobber
had one, then this is probably his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see any strangers around the farm,
did you?&rdquo; asked Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None that I noticed. Of course plenty of folks
have passed up and down the main road, and the
back road, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not long after that when Jack Ness
drove up with the camping outfit. The boys aided
the man in putting the outfit away and also
questioned him concerning Sobber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There was one man, or young fellow, hanging
around,&rdquo; answered Jack Ness. &ldquo;I tried to reach
him, to ask him wot he wanted, but he jumped
the orchard fence and got away. I thought he
might be a tramp, although he wasn&rsquo;t dressed like
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you report him?&rdquo; demanded Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, everybody was a-havin&rsquo; seech a good
time I didn&rsquo;t want to bother you. I watched the
fellow until he was away down the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was he dressed and how did he look in
the face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As well as he was able the hired man described
the individual he had seen. The clothing counted
for nothing, but the face and manner of the person
tallied with that of Tad Sobber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it was Sobber right enough,&rdquo; was
Tom&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;We ought to let dad know
about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will let him know&mdash;first thing tomorrow
morning,&rdquo; answered Dick.</p>
<p>All waited impatiently for some word from Mr.
Rover, but none came in until eight o&rsquo;clock the
next morning. Then the telegram was very brief,
reading as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Bad mix-up, money all gone. Better come on
and help in investigation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad!&rdquo; groaned Dick. &ldquo;I am going to start
for Cedarville by the first train.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; added Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; came from Sam.</p>
<p>Then of a sudden all three lads looked at Fred
and Hans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mind me at all,&rdquo; cried Fred. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
go with you&mdash;as far as Marville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I go so far as Ithaca,&rdquo; added Hans. &ldquo;Py
chiminy! I hopes you cotch dot rascal, Tad Sobber
alretty quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I hope we catch him,&rdquo; answered Dick.</p>
<p>The Rover boys were so used to traveling that
getting ready did not bother them. They knew
they could catch a train for Ithaca in two hours
and so lost no time in packing their dress-suit
cases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to the depot in the auto,&rdquo; said Dick.
&ldquo;Frank Rand can bring the machine back here.&rdquo;
And so it was arranged, Rand being an automobile
owner living at the Run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, boys, I do hope you will take care of
yourselves!&rdquo; cried Aunt Martha, when they were
ready to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Aunty, we&rsquo;ll do that!&rdquo; cried
Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is something to remember me by!&rdquo; added
Tom, and gave her a warm hug and a kiss.
Then the others kissed her, and gave a handshake
to Uncle Randolph.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Dick brought the automobile out, and in all of
the lads piled and Aleck Pop lifted in the dress-suit
cases and Hans&rsquo; bundle. The power was
turned on, and off the touring car moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; was the cry from the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to let us know what is happening!&rdquo;
called out Randolph Rover. &ldquo;And if you
need me, don&rsquo;t hesitate to send for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick turned on more gasolene and advanced the
spark, and soon the big touring car was shooting
along the country road at a speed of twenty-five
miles an hour. They had plenty of time to make
the train, but the Rovers were impatient to get
to Oak Run, to send a message to their parent,
advising him of their coming.</p>
<p>Through the village of Dexter&rsquo;s Corners they
dashed, around a corner, and then straight for
the bridge spanning Swift River. A farm wagon
was making for the bridge from the opposite
shore, and there was not room for both vehicles
to pass on the bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better slow up and wait, Dick!&rdquo; cautioned
Sam, but instead, Dick turned on more power,
and away they sailed over the bridge like the
wind, and past the farm wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew! that&rsquo;s going some!&rdquo; cried Fred. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know as I would have nerve to run a car
like that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dick&rsquo;s a dandy driver,&rdquo; answered Tom,
enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Arriving at the station, they went to the telegraph
office and asked for messages, and found
none. Then word was sent to Anderson Rover
at Cedarville. After that the automobile was
turned over to Frank Rand, who agreed to take
it back to Valley Brook farm that afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off ag&rsquo;in, eh?&rdquo; said Ricks, when they bought
their tickets. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you boys can&rsquo;t
settle down fer awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoking any cigars now, Mr. Ricks.&rdquo; asked
Tom, dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I am, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t none o&rsquo; your business!&rdquo; snapped
the old station agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just heard of a new cure for smoker&rsquo;s jim-jams,&rdquo;
went on the fun-loving youth. &ldquo;You take
a squash and boil it in lard, and then cut it into
thin slices, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want none o&rsquo; your cures!&rdquo; roared Mr.
Ricks savagely. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got no smoker&rsquo;s jim-jams,
nor nuthin&rsquo;. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you saw things, Mr. Ricks, you said you
did. Worms, and snakes, and strange things&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t! I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; howled the old station
agent, growing red in the face. &ldquo;Now you shet
up, do you hear? The boys has been pokin&rsquo; fun
enough at me as it is! Everywhere I go they
ask me about my smokin&rsquo;! I&rsquo;m sick o&rsquo; hearin&rsquo;
about it, an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to stand it, I ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
And he shook his fist in Tom&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry you feel so bad about it, Mr. Ricks,&rdquo;
said Tom coolly. &ldquo;I only wanted to do you a
favor. Now this squash cure is warranted to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you I don&rsquo;t want to hear about
it!&rdquo; shrilled the station agent. &ldquo;You mind your
business, Tom Rover! I know you! Some day
I&rsquo;ll fix you, yes, I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Ricks, I only want to be of service.
Now, if you will only listen. This squash cure
is warranted&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense! I won&rsquo;t listen, do you
hear? I won&rsquo;t listen!&rdquo; The station agent was
fairly dancing up and down. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;There&rsquo;s the
train. Go on with you, and good riddance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom, you&rsquo;ll be the death of Ricks!&rdquo;
laughed Sam, as all of the lads climbed up the
steps of the cars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much! Nothing like that will ever kill
him,&rdquo; answered the fun-loving Rover. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too
tough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get even with you some day,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him&mdash;I&rsquo;m willing,&rdquo; answered Tom, calmly.
He was so fair-minded that he was willing
to take as well as give, when it came to practical
jokes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>The train rolled on, and for the time being the
boys had little to do but talk over the situation.
At a junction point Fred left them. He promised
to write and asked them to send him the particulars
of what they did.</p>
<p>Just before Ithaca was reached, the train was
delayed. As a consequence they missed the last
boat for Cedarville that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Now we won&rsquo;t
be able to get to the Stanhope place until eleven
o&rsquo;clock tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can send a telegram to dad at Cedarville,&rdquo;
said Sam. &ldquo;And maybe we can telephone,&rdquo;
he added.</p>
<p>At Ithaca Hans left them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I keeps mine eyes open for dot Dad Sobber,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;Of I finds him I let you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk, Hans!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;You
play detective and some day perhaps you&rsquo;ll win
a great big leather medal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah, dot&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; answered the German youth,
complacently.</p>
<p>At the telegraph office they sent a message to
their father, who had engaged a room at the new
Cedarville Hotel. They mentioned that they
would go to the Axtell House in Ithaca, and
asked him to communicate with them there by
telephone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>At the Axtell House a surprise awaited them.
Seated in the reading room they found Dan Baxter,
the one-time bully of Putnam Hall, but who
had reformed and who was now a commercial
traveler for a large jewelry concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dan, you here!&rdquo; cried Dick, as Baxter,
on seeing them, rushed up to shake hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; returned the young commercial traveler.
&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t think to have the pleasure of
seeing you,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Thought you&rsquo;d be off
on a summer vacation somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were off camping, but we came this way
on business,&rdquo; answered Sam. &ldquo;How have you
been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First-rate. Don&rsquo;t I look it?&rdquo; and Dan Baxter
smiled openly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly do,&rdquo; put in Tom. &ldquo;Traveling
must agree with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And business is good?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best ever. And what is more to the point,
I&rsquo;ve had a raise in salary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the one you mentioned when you
met us at Ashton,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, another one. You see, a rival firm made
me an offer. My firm heard of it, and they at
once came to me, and told me I mustn&rsquo;t think of
leaving&mdash;and then they tacked another five dollars
per week on my salary,&rdquo; and Dan Baxter&rsquo;s
eyes beamed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;Stick to it, Dan, and
some day you&rsquo;ll be a member of the firm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I am working for. Going to
stay here over night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough. We can talk things over. I
was rather lonely&mdash;not having a soul to talk to.
And by the way, whom do you think was here
some days ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tad Sobber?&rdquo; questioned Dick, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;yes&mdash;he was here. But I wasn&rsquo;t
thinking of him when I spoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who were you thinking of?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Josiah Crabtree. He is out of prison,
you know, and he heard I was stopping here, and
he came to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">DAN BAXTER&rsquo;S REVELATION</span></h2>
<p>The announcement that Josiah Crabtree had
come to see Dan Baxter filled the Rover boys
with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he have much to say?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had a great deal to say,&rdquo; answered Dan.
He looked around at several who had entered the
reading room &ldquo;Come up to my room and I&rsquo;ll
tell you all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will&mdash;after we have notified the clerk
where we will be,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;We are waiting
for a message from our father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys engaged their rooms and had their
dress-suit cases taken up. A few minutes later
the whole crowd entered the apartment Dan Baxter
occupied. They noticed that it was well-kept
and that on the bureau rested a photograph of
Dan&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is he, Dan?&rdquo; asked Dick, motioning to
the picture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fairly well. He is getting old, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you see him next, give him our regards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; answered Dan, and then he motioned
the Rovers to seats and sank down on the edge of
the bed with something of a sigh. In spite of his
success as a commercial traveler Dan could not
help but think of his own past and of his father&rsquo;s
past. How his father might have prospered, even
as the Rovers had prospered, had he followed the
path of fairness and honor! He had reformed
now, but this reform had come too late in life
to enable him to make another start in the business
world. Dan was supporting him, and father
and son were glad enough to have the Rovers drop
their many just causes of complaint against them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you I was much surprised to see
Josiah Crabtree,&rdquo; said Dan, after a pause. &ldquo;I
ask him how he happened to be out of prison,
and he said he was let go because of his good
behavior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would make me laugh,&rdquo; interrupted
Tom. &ldquo;Think of old Crabtree on his good behavior!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he had been following me up for
nearly a week,&rdquo; pursued Dan, and then he paused
and his face grew red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Following you up?&rdquo; cried Sam. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;er&mdash;I might as well make a clean breast
of it, fellows&mdash;although I hope you will keep it to
yourselves. You&rsquo;ll remember how thick Crabtree
and I once were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered all of the Rovers in a low
tone. They could realize how painful the remembrance
of it must be to Dan, now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he had an idea that I was the same old
Dan and ready for new schemes for making
money. He had a scheme, and he wanted me to
help him work it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll remember that he was always
crazy after Mrs. Stanhope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was crazy after her money, and Dora&rsquo;s
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Well, he wanted me to help him in
a scheme against Mrs. Stanhope&mdash;the same old
scheme he tried years ago. He wanted to get her
in his power and force her to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Marry that jailbird!&rdquo; cried Dick, and
his eyes flashed fire. &ldquo;What a father-in-law Josiah
Crabtree would make!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Dick. He talked around the bush a
good deal at first, and I led him on, wanting to
know what he had up his sleeve. He talked about
his affinity and all that, and said that Mrs. Stanhope
really wanted to marry him&mdash;that she had
said so a score of times&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The scoundrel! He tried to hypnotize her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all that as well as you do, Dick. Well,
he said she wanted to marry him, but that her
daughter wouldn&rsquo;t let her, being influenced by
you and the Lanings. He wanted me to aid him
in getting Mrs. Stanhope away from Cedarville,
and he said that as soon as they were married
he would give me five thousand dollars for helping
him to get her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, every word of it. I pumped him
all I could, just to get the details of his plot. But
he wouldn&rsquo;t give me the details&mdash;in fact, I don&rsquo;t
think he had the details worked out. When, at
last, I flatly refused to assist him he went off the
maddest man you ever saw. He warned me not
to say a word to anybody, stating that if I did,
he would put the police on my track on some old
charge. But I made up my mind that I would
write to you, and I&rsquo;d write to Mr. Laning, too&mdash;he
being Mrs. Stanhope&rsquo;s near relative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did he go to?&rdquo; asked Sam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see him the next day, until late in the
evening. Then I was over to Grapeton, to see
a jeweler there, and when I was coming away an
automobile passed me driven by a fellow in a
regular chauffeur&rsquo;s costume. On the back seat
was Crabtree and a fellow who used to go to
Putnam Hall&mdash;the fellow who tried to do the
Stanhopes out of that fortune in court, Tad Sobber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sobber and Crabtree!&rdquo; burst out Dick. &ldquo;They
surely must be together in this deal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly looks like it,&rdquo; added Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess Crabtree is bound to have a part of
the fortune, even if he can&rsquo;t marry Mrs. Stanhope,&rdquo;
said Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Sobber after that fortune again?&rdquo; questioned
the young commercial traveler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are afraid he already has it in his possession,&rdquo;
answered Dick. &ldquo;Now that you have been
kind enough to tell your story, Dan, we&rsquo;ll tell
ours.&rdquo; And he related the particulars of what
had brought them away from the camp at the
lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they are both after that fortune,&rdquo; said
Dan, after listening to the recital. &ldquo;It seems to
me it all fits in. Sobber wanted to get hold of
that cash. He couldn&rsquo;t do it by force, so he had
to use cunning. He is not an overly-brilliant fellow,
I take it, so he had to get somebody to aid
him. In some manner he fell in with Josiah Crabtree.
He knew that Crabtree was as smart as he
was unprincipled. The two fixed up the plot to
get the fortune&mdash;and got it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they haven&rsquo;t got Mrs. Stanhope, too,&rdquo;
murmured Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Crabtree would rather have the money
than have the lady,&rdquo; said Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll know all about the case tomorrow,&rdquo;
said Sam. &ldquo;I am dead tired now and am
going to bed,&rdquo; he added, looking at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quarter to twelve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, Dan, I didn&rsquo;t think we were keeping
you up so late!&rdquo; cried the eldest Rover boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, Dick. I&rsquo;m glad you came&mdash;it
saved me the trouble of sending that letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go to bed,&rdquo; went on Dick, to his
brothers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay up a bit longer and see if any
message comes from dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rovers left Dan Baxter&rsquo;s apartment, and
Sam and Tom retired, both worn out from their
day&rsquo;s exertions. Dick went below, to interview
the hotel clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No message yet, sir,&rdquo; said that individual. &ldquo;If
any comes in I will call you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was about to turn away, when the telephone
bell rang. He waited while the clerk listened
for a moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s here now,&rdquo; he heard the clerk say.
&ldquo;Wait a moment.&rdquo; The clerk turned to Dick.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your party now. I&rsquo;ll switch you into
the booth yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trembling with anticipation, Dick hurried to
the booth, shut the door and took up the telephone
receiver. The wire was buzzing, but presently
he made out his father&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dad. Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the hotel in Cedarville. I just got here a
few minutes ago from a run across the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Across the lake? What for? Did you go
after the fortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I went after Mrs. Stanhope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she is&mdash;is gone?&rdquo; faltered Dick. He
could scarcely speak the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But how did you guess it?&rdquo; And Anderson
Rover&rsquo;s tones showed his surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me first where she went, and how?&rdquo; demanded
Dick, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know how she went, or just when.
It is most mysterious all the way through. Dora
is nearly frantic, for she did not know her mother
was going. We followed her up and learned that
she had crossed the lake in company with some
man who wore a heavy, black beard and dark
goggles.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been Josiah Crabtree,&rdquo; cried
Dick, and then, in as few words as possible, he
told of the meeting with Dan Baxter and what the
young commercial traveler had revealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! yes! that must be the truth of it!&rdquo; said
Anderson Rover. &ldquo;And Crabtree must have been
the one who aided in getting the fortune from the
bank where it was being kept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the money, dad, just now. Tell
me about Mrs. Stanhope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you any more, Dick. I went across
the lake in a launch, but I could get no trace of
her on the other side. Now I am going back to
the Stanhope house, and send Dora over to the
Lanings. I want you to come up here the first
thing in the morning,&rdquo; added Mr. Rover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be up, and so will Sam and Tom,&rdquo; answered
Dick, and then after a few words more
the telephone talk came to an end.</p>
<p>Dick slept but little that night. His one thought
was of Mrs. Stanhope. What had become of
her? Was it possible that Josiah Crabtree had
in some way used his sinister influence to get her
to leave her home, and would he be able to hypnotize
her into marrying him?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he does that it will break Dora&rsquo;s heart!&rdquo;
he groaned. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s an outrage! We don&rsquo;t
want such a scoundrel in the family!&rdquo; And he
grated his teeth in just indignation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>The first boat for Cedarville left directly after
the breakfast hour. The Rovers dined with Dan
Baxter and then bade the young commercial traveler
good-bye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep my eyes open for Crabtree and Sobber,&rdquo;
said Dan. &ldquo;And if I see either of &rsquo;em
I&rsquo;ll let you know at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Send word instantly&mdash;at
my expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys boarded the same little steamer, the
<i>Golden Star</i>, which had first taken them up Cayuga
Lake, when on their way to become pupils at
Putnam Hall. The captain remembered them
and spoke to them cordially. But none of the
lads was in the humor of talking to outsiders.</p>
<p>As soon as Cedarville was reached they rushed
ashore at the well-known dock. They were going
to look around for a public carriage to take them
to the Stanhope residence, some distance away,
when a voice hailed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, boys, I am glad to see you!&rdquo; came in
hearty tones, and the next instant they were
shaking hands with Captain Putnam, the owner
of the school which they had attended so many
years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are sorry, Captain, that we can&rsquo;t stop to
talk,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;but we are in a tremendous
hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I know why,&rdquo; answered the owner
of the school. &ldquo;I met your father yesterday.
Want to go to the Stanhope place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come with me. I have my carriage here,
and my best team, and I&rsquo;ll take pleasure in driving
you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; answered Tom. &ldquo;My! I
almost feel as if I was going back to the school!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad to have you back, Thomas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In spite of my pranks, Captain?&rdquo; and Tom
grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in spite of your pranks,&rdquo; answered Captain
Putnam, promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think we are after Josiah Crabtree!&rdquo;
murmured Sam. &ldquo;How time changes things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust you catch him, and catch that Tad
Sobber, too,&rdquo; answered Captain Putnam, gravely.</p>
<p>The team was a spirited one, and the captain
knew well how to handle them. Away they flew,
through the village and then out on the smooth
road leading to the Stanhope place. Dick relapsed
into silence. He was thinking of Dora and of the
girl&rsquo;s missing mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">A FORTUNE AND A LADY DISAPPEAR</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s all I know about it, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Dora who was speaking. She was seated
on the sofa with Dick beside her. She had
been telling her story and weeping copiously at
the same time. He had listened with great interest,
and had comforted her all he could. Tom
and Sam had gone off with Mr. Rover, to the
Laning place, to interview Mr. Laning and his
wife and see if they could throw any additional
light on the mystery.</p>
<p>What Dora had to tell was not much, and it
simply supplemented the story Mr. Rover had
already related to his sons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>One day a strange messenger had appeared at
the Stanhope house with a letter for Mrs. Stanhope.
The communication was very brief and asked
the lady to get the fortune from the trust
company that was holding it and take it to Ithaca
and there meet Mr. Rover. She was to do this
in secret, for, as the letter said, Mr. Rover &ldquo;wanted
to make an investment of great importance,
but one which must be kept from the general public,
or the chance to buy stock at a low price would
be lost.&rdquo; The communication had been signed
in the name of the Rover boys&rsquo; father.</p>
<p>Rather ignorant of business affairs, Mrs. Stanhope
had taken the first boat she could get for
Ithaca and gone to the trust company and gotten
from her private box the whole fortune&mdash;her own
share and also that of the Lanings. There she
had gone to the office of the Adrell Lumber Company,
where, so the letter stated, Mr. Rover was
to meet her.</p>
<p>The Adrell company&rsquo;s office proved to be a
small affair on a side street, and on entering Mrs.
Stanhope had met the messenger who had delivered
the letter to her the day before. He had
said that Mr. Rover was expected every minute
and had requested her to sit down.</p>
<p>While the lady was waiting, with the fortune
in her valise, a telephone had rung and the man
in the office had gone to answer the call. He said
Mr. Rover wished to speak to her. She had answered
the telephone, and someone had spoken to
her in a voice she believed to be Anderson Rover&rsquo;s.
The party at the other end of the wire
had said he was then dickering for some valuable
mining shares owned by a rich old man, and said
the shares would surely go up to double value inside
of a month.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave the old man,&rdquo; came over the
wire. &ldquo;Is Mr. Barker there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in the office had said he was Mr. Barker,
and then the man on the wire had vouchsafed
the additional information to Mrs. Stanhope that
he was an old friend and perfectly trustworthy.
Then Mrs. Stanhope had been requested to turn
the fortune over to Mr. Barker, who would deliver
it to Mr. Rover without delay.</p>
<p>Thinking that all was fair and square, Mrs.
Stanhope had delivered the valise to the man,
who had gone off with it immediately. He had
told her to go home and Mr. Rover would send
her word before night about what he had
done.</p>
<p>She had returned to Cedarville and to her home
and there she had waited patiently to hear from
Anderson Rover. No message coming for her,
she had at last grown suspicious and sent word
to the hotel at which the Rover boys&rsquo; father was
supposed to be stopping. On receiving a reply
that he was not there, and had not been there, she
grew more alarmed than ever, and then sent the
message to Oak Run which so mystified all of the
Rovers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have learned that the Adrell Lumber
Company went out of business several months
ago,&rdquo; explained Dora. &ldquo;The old signs were left
up and the office was rented temporarily to a man
who said he wanted to use it for storage purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was rented that way just to fool your
mother,&rdquo; returned Dick.</p>
<p>On learning the truth Mrs. Stanhope had been
all but overcome. She had sent word to Mr. Laning,
but he could not come, having hurt his
ankle as already mentioned.</p>
<p>Then, while Dora and her mother were in the
house alone, another message had come. It was
signed Tad Sobber, and stated that Sobber had
the fortune and would return the greater portion
of it provided Mrs. Stanhope would allow him to
keep ten thousand dollars and promise not to
prosecute him. If she agreed to this, she was
to meet a certain man in Cedarville, who would
take her across the lake, where she could meet
Sobber and get back her valise with her precious
belongings. She was particularly cautioned to
come alone&mdash;otherwise the fortune would not be
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she went across the lake, and that is the
last seen or heard of her,&rdquo; said Dora, and then
she burst into fresh tears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen anything lately of Josiah Crabtree?&rdquo;
questioned Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but mamma got a long letter from him, in
which he said he loved her more than ever and
that she had better make up her mind to marry
him. The letter was so sickening mamma tore
it up and put it in the stove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dora, I hate to alarm you more, but I think
Crabtree had something to do with getting your
mother to cross the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you say that, Dick?&rdquo; she demanded,
with a new fear coming into her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; he answered, and then related
the particulars of the meeting with Dan Baxter.
When he concluded her face was very pale and
her hands icy cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dick, would that&mdash;that monster carry her
off and&mdash;and force mamma to marry him!&rdquo; she
moaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t answer that, Dora. But you&rsquo;ll remember
what a strange influence Crabtree used to exercise
over her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! yes! But mamma was sickly then and
her mind was weak. Now she is much stronger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Crabtree is something of a hypnotist
and mesmerist, and there is no telling what such
a rascal will do when he sets out for it. He wants
that fortune just as much as Sobber wants it. I
think they are working this game between them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why would they take mamma away after
they had the fortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the fortune is not all in gold. There
is some very rare jewelry and precious stones.
The thieves would have trouble in disposing of
those things unless they had some semblance of
a legal right to do so. If Mr. Crabtree was your
mother&rsquo;s husband he could take the jewelry and
precious stones and sell them, and nobody would
prosecute him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dick, what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that you can do anything, Dora.
My advice is, that you go over and stay with the
Lanings, and let us try to solve this mystery.
We&rsquo;ll do all we can, and we&rsquo;ll make the authorities
do all they can, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cedarville police are of no account&mdash;in
a matter of such importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that. Father sent to New York for a
couple of first-class detectives. Perhaps they&rsquo;ll
be able to get on the trail quicker than any of us
realize.&rdquo; But though Dick spoke thus it was
more to allay Dora&rsquo;s anxiety than through any
faith in what the sleuths of the law might be
able to accomplish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>The matter was talked over a little longer, and
then Dora dressed and packed her suit-case and
announced herself ready to go to the Laning
farm, located some distance away. Dick drove
her over. They found the whole household in
excitement over what had occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare, that fortune has brought nothing
but trouble from the start,&rdquo; said Mrs. Laning,
with a deep sigh. &ldquo;Sometimes I wish we had
never heard of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t care so much for the fortune, if
only I knew mamma was safe!&rdquo; answered Dora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going down to Cedarville and see if I
can&rsquo;t get on the trail of the party who took your
mother across the lake,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll go along,&rdquo; came from Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So will I,&rdquo; added Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to Ithaca, to look into that lumber
office business,&rdquo; said Mr. Rover. &ldquo;I want to get
a good description of the fellow who got that
valise with the fortune.&rdquo; In his excitement he
did not think of his injured knee.</p>
<p>All drove to Cedarville, and there Mr. Rover
took the boat down Lake Cayuga. The boys
walked along the docks, looking for a man named
Belcher, who rented out small boats. They found
the fellow at a boathouse, putting a new seat in a
rowboat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything of this affair?&rdquo; asked
Dick, after he had learned how the news of Mrs.
Stanhope&rsquo;s disappearance, and the disappearance
of the fortune, had spread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just thinking I might know something,&rdquo;
answered Caleb Belcher, slowly. He was known
to be a man who never hurried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked the three Rovers, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The boatman slowly shifted his
quid of tobacco from one side of his mouth to the
other. &ldquo;I was thinking I might know a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what? Tell us, man!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
keep us waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t much,&rdquo; was the slow reply. &ldquo;I was
out rowing, you understand&mdash;coming from the
Point to Harden&rsquo;s dock, when I see a boat I
didn&rsquo;t know, moving across the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sam, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She put across the lake, and she had two men
and a woman in her. The woman wore a dark
dress and a dark veil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been Mrs. Stanhope!&rdquo; cried
Dick. &ldquo;When was this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the same time they say the lady disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did the boat go to?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I was kind of curious to know whose
boat it was, so I watched pretty closely, and she
went in over there,&rdquo; and the old boatman pointed
with his hand to a spot on the opposite shore
where there was a tall rock and a fair-sized cove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take us over there at once and I&rsquo;ll pay you
well,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Get out two pairs of oars,
and we&rsquo;ll help you to row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slow though he was, Caleb Belcher was always
anxious to earn money, and soon a rowboat was
gotten ready and the three Rover boys sprang in.
The old boatman followed, and the craft was
headed across the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who lives near that spot?&rdquo; questioned Dick,
as they swept over the calm bosom of the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tony Carew&rsquo;s farm isn&rsquo;t far off,&rdquo; answered
the old boatman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know this Tony Carew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I do&mdash;we went to school together, and
licked each other more&rsquo;n a dozen times,&rdquo; and
Caleb Belcher chuckled over the recollection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, show us to his place,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>As soon as the shore was reached all sprang
out of the boat, which was tied to a bush growing
nearby. Then Caleb Belcher led the way along
a trail that was rather rough. Presently they
came to a road and on it an old farmhouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is Tony Carew now,&rdquo; said Belcher, and
pointed to an old man who sat on a bench, smoking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have nuthin&rsquo; to do with it&mdash;you can&rsquo;t
mix me up in it!&rdquo; cried Tony Carew, as soon as
Dick stated the object of his visit. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tech
the lady!&rdquo; And he bobbed his head vigorously.
Evidently he was a man easily scared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to learn if you know anything about
it,&rdquo; returned Dick, sternly. &ldquo;If you do, tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tech the lady! I wouldn&rsquo;t tech nobuddy!&rdquo;
howled Tony Carew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see her and the men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t tech nobuddy, I tell you.
I stayed in the barn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you saw her!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;Where did
she go? Or where did those men take her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hull crowd got in a carriage wot was
waitin&rsquo; down the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose carriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno. They had a white hoss an&rsquo; a black
hoss, an&rsquo; the carriage had the top kinder torn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was driving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man with a linen duster, an&rsquo; a cap pulled
away down over his face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way did they go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That way,&rdquo; answered Tony Carew, and
pointed to a side road leading eastward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">ON THE WAY TO BOSTON</span></h2>
<p>The Rover boys gazed down the road with interest.
It ran between a number of tall trees, and
looked to be lonely in the extreme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does it lead to?&rdquo; asked Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old road, running to Shaville,&rdquo; answered
Tony Carew. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t hardly used any
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is why those rascals took it,&rdquo; answered
Dick. &ldquo;They wanted to keep in the dark
as much as possible. How far to Shaville?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout two miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you take us over in a carriage? We&rsquo;ll
pay you, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure! But, say, honestly, I didn&rsquo;t have
nuthin&rsquo; to do with carryin&rsquo; her off!&rdquo; cried the old
farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; answered Dick. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a
pity you didn&rsquo;t report what you knew to the Cedarville
police.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to git in no trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want me any more?&rdquo; asked Caleb Belcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may want you,&rdquo; answered Dick. &ldquo;Stay
here for a couple of hours, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My price is twenty-five cents an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;and there&rsquo;s a dollar on account,&rdquo;
and Dick passed the money over.</p>
<p>A fairly good horse and wagon were brought
from the barn, and the boys and Tony Carew got
in. Then the horse was urged forward, and
over the uneven road they bumped, in the direction
of the village of Shaville, a sleepy community,
with one store, a blacksmith shop, a church,
and about a dozen cottages.</p>
<p>When Shaville was reached the boys commenced
a diligent search for some news concerning
the carriage with the white and the black
horse and the dilapidated top. At first they could
find nobody who had seen such a turnout, but
presently they met a tramp whom Sam stopped,
and he gave them news that was surprising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see &rsquo;em!&rdquo; cried the tramp. &ldquo;Say, boss, give
me a dollar an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell you all I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell all you know without the dollar!&rdquo;
cried Dick, and grabbed the knight of the road
by the collar. &ldquo;Come now, tell me, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/imag2.jpg" alt="&ldquo;YOU&rsquo;LL TELL ALL YOU KNOW WITHOUT THE DOLLAR!&rdquo; CRIED DICK." width="500" height="772" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;YOU&rsquo;LL TELL ALL YOU KNOW WITHOUT THE DOLLAR!&rdquo; CRIED DICK.</span></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt me!&rdquo; yelled the tramp. &ldquo;I was
only foolin&rsquo;. Course I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>He was subjected to close questioning, and
from him it was learned that the carriage with the
three men and the lady had passed through Shaville
and turned towards Latown. The lady had
tried to jump from the carriage just while it was
passing the tramp, but the men had held her back.
He had heard the men mention Latown, and also
speak of an automobile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One feller was an old gent, who looked like a
perfesser,&rdquo; said the tramp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must have been Crabtree,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be that they were going to leave the
carriage and take to an auto at Latown?&rdquo; came
from Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; answered Dick. &ldquo;If they did take
to an auto it will be mighty hard to find them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tossing the tramp a quarter, they went on their
way, and presently reached Latown, and there
hurried to the only garage the place possessed.
There they learned that the garage owner had
rented a touring car out several days before and
it had not yet been returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow who rented it was to pay me ten
dollars a day, but I didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d keep it so
long,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;He gave me his card.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it is my card!&rdquo; ejaculated Dick, on
glancing at the pasteboard. &ldquo;The nerve of him!
Of course it was Sobber&mdash;or one of his cronies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>It was not until nightfall that the boys learned
what had become of the touring car. Then they
found a boy who had seen the car, with three men
and two women in it, speeding towards the Albany
road. This lad took them to the very spot
where he had seen the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the ladies was terribly excited,&rdquo; said
the lad. &ldquo;When she saw me, she shouted something
and then threw one of her hair combs at
me. Here is the comb now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be Mrs. Stanhope&rsquo;s,&rdquo; was Dick&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;She wanted it to be used to trace her by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hers,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I remember, she had
a pair of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she shout?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t make out, exactly. It sounded like
Boston&mdash;but I ain&rsquo;t sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boston?&rdquo; repeated Dick. &ldquo;Oh, it can&rsquo;t be!
That is too far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might be headed for Boston. There is
a fine road for autos from Albany to the Hub&mdash;the
old post-road,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll telephone along the line and try to find
out where they went,&rdquo; answered Dick.</p>
<p>It was not until the next day that word came
in from Albany that the automobile had been seen
in that city. It had stopped at a garage to have a
tire fixed. No one was in it at the time but a
young man. He appeared to be in a great hurry,
and had paid well for a rapid repair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>From Albany the auto was traced across the
Hudson river and to North Adams. But that was
the last heard of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to North Adams,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if they did really go to Boston,&rdquo;
said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they could make the run in a day if
they tried real hard. The distance is only about
a hundred and fifty miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of the boys resolved to go to North Adams,
and sent word to Cedarville to that effect. In return
came a telegram from Mr. Rover, reading as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Run them down if you possibly can. Do not
spare expense.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As if I would spare any expense!&rdquo; murmured
Dick. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give all I possess to put Mrs. Stanhope
back in her home, and put Josiah Crabtree
back in prison!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And put Sobber in prison, too,&rdquo; added Tom.</p>
<p>In North Adams the lads quite unexpectedly
ran into Spud Jackson, who had been spending a
few weeks with some relatives in the Berkshires.
Spud was immediately interested in what the
Rovers had to tell and proposed something that
met with immediate approval.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My uncle Dan has got a dandy car&mdash;fast as
they make &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Spud. &ldquo;Can go about a
hundred miles an hour, I guess. Well, he lets
me run it whenever I want to. Say the word and
we&rsquo;ll start for Boston tomorrow, and make inquiries
all along the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you have the use of the car, Spud?&rdquo;
asked Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positively. Uncle Dan said I could make a
tour of the White Mountains if I wished, but I
don&rsquo;t care for the scenery much&mdash;too much of it,
I guess. But going to Boston, to catch those rascals,
would hit me plumb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was arranged that they should start eastward
in the morning, and in the meantime Dick
and his brothers sent out more messages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you think the other woman in that
touring car can be?&rdquo; asked Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Sam,&rdquo; answered his eldest
brother. &ldquo;Perhaps some unscrupulous party who
was hired by Crabtree to look after Mrs. Stanhope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad said he had heard that Sobber got his
money to go to court from a woman who was
his great aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she may be the one&mdash;most likely she
is. I am only afraid of one thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That by some means old Crabtree will force
Mrs. Stanhope to marry him before we can rescue
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why she doesn&rsquo;t try to run away,&rdquo;
came from Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably she has tried, Sam; but they watch
her too closely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they went to Boston, what will they do
there?&rdquo; queried Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;maybe take a liner for Europe,
or to some other part of the earth. You must remember,
they are playing for a big stake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The touring car that Spud brought around the
next morning was certainly an elegant affair. It
seated five and was of sixty-horse power. Spud
quickly demonstrated that he knew how to run
the machine, so Dick did not offer to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you do the bossing,&rdquo; said Spud. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
run her anywhere you please, even if you want
to go to the top of Mount Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going after that other auto, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo;
answered Dick, grimly.</p>
<p>The weather was ideal for touring and had they
not been under such a mental strain the Rover
boys would have enjoyed riding greatly. But
they could think of nothing but Mrs. Stanhope
and the missing fortune.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose Dora is waiting every hour to hear
from us,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and the Lanings are waiting, too,&rdquo; added
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And dad, and the folks at home,&rdquo; supplemented
Sam.</p>
<p>They had sent a number of messages to Cedarville
and now sent another, telling of their plans,
and mentioning some towns at which they expected
to stop. To this message no answer was
returned until they reached Worcester, on the
afternoon of the following day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, here&rsquo;s news!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;Say, we
want to get to Boston just as soon as we can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the others, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father has received a postal card, mailed from
Boston. It is signed by Mrs. Stanhope, and asked
for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she give any address?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says all there is of the address is 234
Carm. He says the rest is rubbed out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can find out in a directory what
Carm stands for,&rdquo; suggested Spud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, Spud. Say, will you get us to Boston
just as soon as possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure will.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About thirty-five miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can make it in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And Spud closed one eye suggestively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t arrest us for speeding. It&rsquo;s
against the law to run fast, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, we&rsquo;ll have to take a chance,&rdquo; declared
Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a case of necessity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as they were outside of the city limits,
Spud turned on the gasolene and advanced the
spark, until the touring car was making forty
and then forty-five miles per hour. On they tore,
through Westboro and other places, and then on
towards Wellesley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, here, that you don&rsquo;t run down any
college girls!&rdquo; warned Dick, as they came in sight
of Wellesley College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t run down any girls for the
world!&rdquo; answered Spud, as he slowed down a bit.
Soon the main street of Wellesley was left behind
and on they sped for Newton and the Hub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! hi!&rdquo; came a sudden call from the roadway,
and a policeman appeared, waving his hand
frantically.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, but we can&rsquo;t stop to talk!&rdquo; flung back
Spud, and in a minute the officer of the law became
a mere speck in the distance. He had not
gotten their number, so could do nothing.</p>
<p>They were just entering Boston proper when
a loud report came from one of the rear tires.
The car swerved to one side, and Spud had all
he could do to keep it from going into a hitching
post. Then he shut off the power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A blow-out!&rdquo; announced Tom, as he leaped
to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ends running for the present,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it does,&rdquo; agreed Spud, mournfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">AN ADVENTURE IN BOSTON</span></h2>
<p>The Rover boys looked at each other inquiringly.
They wanted to go on, but did not know
what to do about the stalled automobile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go ahead,&rdquo; said Spud, reading their
thoughts. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix the tire, or have it done by
some garage man, and I&rsquo;ll see you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the Parker House&mdash;that is where my
uncle always goes,&rdquo; answered Spud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well&mdash;we&rsquo;ll call for you or send a message,&rdquo;
said Tom. &ldquo;Come on, here is a trolley!&rdquo;
And he ran to stop the car. Soon he and his
brothers were on board and bound for the heart
of the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, do you know any street in town that begins
with Carm?&rdquo; questioned Dick, of the car
conductor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carm?&rdquo; repeated the man, slowly. &ldquo;No, I
don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t believe there is such a street.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the streets pretty well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to&mdash;I drove an express wagon for
four years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That looks as if we were up against it,&rdquo; said
Dick, to his brothers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go in a drug store and consult a city
directory,&rdquo; answered Sam. &ldquo;He may think he
knows all the streets, but every city has a lot of
places even the oldest inhabitant doesn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rode on a few blocks further and then,
seeing a large drug store, alighted from the car
and entered the place. A directory was handy,
on a stand, and they asked for permission to
consult it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like Carm here,&rdquo; said Tom, after
they had looked at the alphabetical list of streets.
&ldquo;We are stumped, sure enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! I&rsquo;ve got it&mdash;I think!&rdquo; burst out Sam,
so loudly that the attention of several persons in
the store was attracted to him. &ldquo;Here is a Varmolet
street. Maybe Mrs. Stanhope only heard the
name, and thought it was Carmolet. She wrote
that down, and the end became rubbed off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be right, Sam,&rdquo; answered Dick.
&ldquo;Anyway, I guess your idea is worth looking into.
I wonder where Varmolet street is?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>They made several inquiries, and at last learned
that the street was a narrow and exceedingly
crooked affair about half a mile away. They
boarded another street car to visit the neighborhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look who is here!&rdquo; ejaculated Tom, as he and
his brothers sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; cried Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry Koswell and Bart Larkspur!&rdquo; murmured
Dick.</p>
<p>It was indeed the two former students of
Brill&mdash;the lads who had run away after causing
the Rovers and some others so much trouble.
Both were loudly dressed in summer outing flannels,
and each carried an unlighted cigarette in
his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted Jerry Koswell, as he glared
at the Rovers. &ldquo;Where did you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we might ask the same question,&rdquo;
returned Dick, coldly.</p>
<p>This meeting was not at all to his taste, especially
when he and his brothers wished to turn
their whole attention to locating Mrs. Stanhope
and her enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been following us?&rdquo; demanded Bart
Larkspur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Larkspur, we have something of more
importance to do,&rdquo; answered Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! you needn&rsquo;t get gay, Rover!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get gay if I wish,&rdquo; retorted Tom, sharply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You had better not follow us,&rdquo; came in ugly
tones from Jerry Koswell. &ldquo;If you do you&rsquo;ll
get yourselves in hot water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Koswell, and you too, Larkspur,&rdquo;
said Dick, in a low but distinct tone. &ldquo;We know
all about what you did at Brill&mdash;and so do the
authorities know it. Just at present we haven&rsquo;t
time to bother with you. But some day we may
get after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! you can&rsquo;t scare me!&rdquo; snorted Koswell.
Yet his face showed that he was disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you staying in Boston?&rdquo; asked Sam,
somewhat curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we are bound for a trip up the coast
to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Jerry, don&rsquo;t tell &rsquo;em where we are
going,&rdquo; interrupted Larkspur. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of their
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day we&rsquo;ll get after you,&rdquo; said Dick.
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve got to leave you,&rdquo; he added, as the
car conductor called out the name of Varmolet
street, as Dick had requested him to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep your distance!&rdquo; shouted Koswell
after the Rover boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not afraid of you!&rdquo; added Larkspur,
and then the car went on again, and the two
former students of Brill were lost to view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are off on some kind of a trip,&rdquo; said
Sam. &ldquo;Evidently they have quite some money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More money than brains,&rdquo; returned Tom,
bluntly. &ldquo;If their folks don&rsquo;t take &rsquo;em in hand,
they&rsquo;ll both end up in prison some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Koswell mentioned a trip up the coast,&rdquo; said
Dick. &ldquo;They must be going up to Portland and
Casco Bay, or further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go to Casco Bay myself,&rdquo; said Sam.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful spot, with its islands. Tom Favor
was telling me all about it. He spent three
summers there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had alighted at the corner of Varmolet
street and now started to look for No. 234. They
had to walk two blocks, past houses that were disreputable
in the extreme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the look of this neighborhood,&rdquo;
remarked Sam, as they hurried along. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate
to visit it after dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of what Mrs. Stanhope must be suffering,
if they brought her to such a spot,&rdquo; returned
Dick, and could not help shuddering.</p>
<p>Presently they reached No. 234, an old three-storied
house, with a dingy front porch, and with
solid wooden shutters, the majority of which were
tightly closed. Not a soul was in sight around the
place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ring any bell,&rdquo; warned Sam. &ldquo;If those
rascals are here they may take the alarm and
skip out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any bell to ring,&rdquo; answered Tom,
grimly. &ldquo;There was once an old-fashioned
knocker, but it has been broken off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think one of us ought to try to get around to
the back,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;If those rascals are here
they may try to escape that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; returned Tom. &ldquo;But let us
make sure first that we have the right place. The
folks living here may be all-right people, and
they&rsquo;d think it strange to see us spying around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick looked up and down the street and saw
a girl eight or nine years old sitting on a porch
some distance away, minding a baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell me who lives in that house?&rdquo; he
asked, of the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, old Mr. Mason lives there,&rdquo; was the
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He&rsquo;s a very old man&mdash;&rsquo;most ninety
years old, so they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he live there alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that is, all the rest of his family are
dead. He has a housekeeper, Mrs. Sobber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Sobber!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old is she?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;maybe forty or fifty. She&rsquo;s
been Mr. Mason&rsquo;s housekeeper for three or four
years. If you call on her, you want to look out.
She don&rsquo;t buy from agents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Dick, innocently. He did not
mind that the little girl took him to be an agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she is too sharp and miserly, I guess. She
used to get me to do her errands for her&mdash;but she
never paid me even a cent for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody else in the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not regular. Once in a while a young man
comes to see Mrs. Sobber. He ain&rsquo;t her son, but
he&rsquo;s some kind of a relation. I think she&rsquo;s his
aunt, or great aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you seen anybody else coming
lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been away lately&mdash;down to my grandfather&rsquo;s
farm. I came back last night. I wish
I was back on the farm,&rdquo; added the little girl,
wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, maybe you&rsquo;ll get back some day,&rdquo;
said Dick, cheerily. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something for you,&rdquo;
and he dropped a silver dime in her lap, something
that pleased her greatly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the place!&rdquo; cried the eldest Rover boy,
on rejoining his brothers. &ldquo;An old man lives
here, and a Mrs. Sobber is his housekeeper. She
is some relation to Tad, I feel sure. Maybe she
is the one who advanced him some money.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe she is the woman seen in the auto
with Mrs. Stanhope,&rdquo; added Tom, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are sure of all this, hadn&rsquo;t we better
notify the police?&rdquo; came from Sam. &ldquo;Remember,
we have not only Tad Sobber against us, but also
old Crabtree, and one or two unknown men. In
a hand-to-hand fight we might get the worst of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea, Sam. Run up to the corner
and see if you can find a policeman,&rdquo; said
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I know how to get to the rear of that
building,&rdquo; mused Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go through that
alleyway and jump the fences,&rdquo; and he pointed to
an alleyway several houses away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Tom. You do that, and I&rsquo;ll get in
the front way somehow. I&rsquo;m not going to wait
another minute. They may have seen us already,
and be getting out by some way of which we
know nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus speaking, Dick mounted the porch and
rapped loudly on the door with his bare knuckles.
Tom ran off and disappeared down the alleyway
he had pointed out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>Dick listened and then rapped again, this time
louder than before. Then he heard a movement
inside the house, but nobody came to answer his
summons. He tried the door, to find it locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Sobber, who is that?&rdquo; asked a trembling
and high-pitched voice&mdash;the voice of the old man
who owned the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s only a peddler; don&rsquo;t go to the door,&rdquo;
answered a woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a peddler!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;I have business
in this house, and I want to come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go away, or I&rsquo;ll set the dog on you!&rdquo;
cried the woman, and now Dick heard her moving
around at the back of the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Sobber, I want you to open this door!&rdquo;
went on Dick, sharply. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;ll get
yourself into serious trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to be bit by the dog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want to be bit by a dog,&rdquo; answered
Dick. He listened but heard nothing of such an
animal. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you have a dog. Will
you open, or shall I bring a policeman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy on us, a policeman!&rdquo; gasped the
woman. &ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; demanded the old
man. &ldquo;Open that door, Mrs. Sobber, and let me
see who is there. I don&rsquo;t understand this. Day
before yesterday you brought those strange folks,
and now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! hush!&rdquo; interrupted the woman, in agitated
tones. &ldquo;Not another word, Mr. Mason.
You are too old to understand. Leave it all to
me. I will soon send that fellow outside about
his business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my house, and I want to know what
is going on here!&rdquo; shrilled the old man, and Dick
heard him tottering across the floor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll open
the door myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no! not yet!&rdquo; answered the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mason, I want to come in!&rdquo; cried Dick
loudly. &ldquo;There has been a crime committed. If
you don&rsquo;t want to be a party to it, open the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A crime,&rdquo; faltered the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a crime. Open the door at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, you&mdash;er&mdash;you shall not!&rdquo; stormed the
woman, and Dick heard her shove the old man
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mason, for the last time, will you let me
in?&rdquo; shouted Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo; answered the old man. &ldquo;But Mrs.
Sobber won&rsquo;t let me open the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll open it myself,&rdquo; answered Dick, and
hurled his weight against the barrier. It was
old and dilapidated and gave way with ease; and
a moment later Dick stepped into the hallway of
the old house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">FROM ONE CLUE TO ANOTHER</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what do you want?&rdquo; asked the old man,
as he eyed Dick, curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to talk to that woman, first of all,&rdquo;
cried Dick, and he pointed to Mrs. Sobber, who
was just disappearing through a door in the rear
of the hallway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what does this mean?&rdquo; went on Mr. Mason,
in a faint voice. &ldquo;I have done nothing
wrong.&rdquo; And now he sank on a rush-bottomed
chair, all out of breath. He was very old, and
his hair and his face were exceedingly white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back and tell you,&rdquo; went on Dick. He
could see at a glance that the old owner of the
building had had nothing to do with the stealing
of the fortune or the abduction of Mrs. Stanhope.</p>
<p>Dick ran to the door at the back of the hallway,
to find it locked. He threw his weight
against it, but it did not give way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>He was on the point of pushing on the door
again, when a cry from the yard reached his
ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick! Dick! Come and stop them!&rdquo; It was
Tom who was calling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming, Tom!&rdquo; he yelled back. And then
he landed on the door with all his might.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t br&mdash;break the door!&rdquo; gasped the old
man. &ldquo;If you want to get out to the back, go
up and down the stairs,&rdquo; and he pointed a trembling
finger upward.</p>
<p>Dick understood, and ran up the front stairs
three steps at a time. He passed through a short
hallway and then reached a stairs, running down
to a back entry way. As he went down these stairs
there came another cry from Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick! Dick! they are getting away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As fast as he could, Dick reached the entryway
and threw open the outer door. He came out in
a small yard, surrounded on three sides by a high
board fence. At the rear was a gate, and this
was wide open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom! you are hurt!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick, as he
caught sight of his brother flat on his back, and
with the blood oozing from a cut on his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the rascal hit me in the head with a
club!&rdquo; gasped poor Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What rascal?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tad Sobber!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ran out of the gate&mdash;and a woman just followed
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see anybody else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Go after &rsquo;em,&rdquo; added the injured youth,
pluckily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you badly hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess not. But he gave me an awful
crack!&rdquo; And pulling himself up, Tom staggered
to a wood-chopping block and sat down.</p>
<p>Dick waited to hear no more, but made for the
gate and ran into an alleyway beyond. This made
a turn and came out on a street behind that upon
which the house was located. Dick looked up and
down the crooked thoroughfare, but could see no
signs of Tad Sobber or the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see a young man and a woman come
out of here?&rdquo; asked Dick, of a boy who was
playing with a ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I did,&rdquo; answered the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did they go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took the auto and went that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An auto?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it waiting here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody in it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A man was running it. He was here yesterday,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see who he took out yesterday?&rdquo; went
on Dick, growing interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came twice. Once he had a lady and a
gent for passengers. They came out of that alleyway,
just as you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just about supper time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick ran down the street in the direction the
automobile had taken. He could see no signs of
the machine, and presently returned to the back
yard where he had left Tom. There the pair
were joined by Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were too late&mdash;they got away!&rdquo; said Dick,
with something like a groan in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not too late for Tad Sobber to leave me
his card!&rdquo; muttered Tom, putting his hand to the
cut on his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to have that tended to, Tom,&rdquo; said
Dick, kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t so bad. I&rsquo;ll put some court-plaster
on it, after I&rsquo;ve washed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I couldn&rsquo;t locate a policeman
anywhere,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, I guess a policeman would only
be in the way,&rdquo; returned his oldest brother. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d
ask a lot of questions, and let it go at that. I&rsquo;m
going into the house, and see if I can find out
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Mrs. Stanhope is in there,&rdquo; cried
Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;they have taken her off in an auto, I am
almost sure of it, Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three Rover boys entered the old house, to
find Mr. Mason walking nervously up and down
in the parlor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Mrs. Sobber?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine she has run away,&rdquo; answered Dick.
He drew a long breath. &ldquo;Mr. Mason, I am going
to ask you some questions. If you wish to avoid
trouble with the authorities, you will answer me
directly and truthfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! I felt that something was wrong!&rdquo;
cried the old man. &ldquo;I want no trouble, I am too
old and respectable. What is it all about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Briefly, a lady has been abducted and a fortune
has been stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then the lady they said was&mdash;er&mdash;insane,
was not insane at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they tell you she was insane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is what Mrs. Sobber and one of the
men said. They said they were going to take her
to a private asylum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The villains!&rdquo; burst out Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What asylum?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that. But I overheard them
talking about taking a boat to Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland?&rdquo; repeated Dick. &ldquo;Are you sure they
were bound for that city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am not sure of anything&mdash;I am only telling
you what I overheard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell us all about those men who came
here, and about the lady, and about Mrs. Sobber,&rdquo;
pursued Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better get after the auto?&rdquo; asked
Tom, who believed in action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Sam can try to hunt it up,&rdquo; answered
the elder Rover. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hear all Mr. Mason can
tell first. It may give us a direct clue. I&rsquo;ll meet
you later at the Parker House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam and Tom went off, and then Dick listened
patiently to the rather rambling tale Oliver Mason
had to tell. The old man said that he had known
Mrs. Sobber when her husband was alive and had
hired her to be his housekeeper after the death of
his three sisters and his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was all alone in the world excepting for
a young man named Tad Sobber, who came to see
her once in a while,&rdquo; said Oliver Mason. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t like the young man much, but the two had
quite some business together.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>The old man then told how Mrs. Sobber had
gone away for several days, stating she must look
after a lady friend who had become insane. She
stated that possibly she would bring the lady to
the house for a day or two, but that if she did,
Mr. Mason need not be afraid, for a doctor and
a nurse would come along. Then the lady had
arrived, in company with Tad Sobber and two
men. He had not been allowed to talk to the
woman, the others saying she might become violent
in the presence of strangers. Then the lady
had been taken away by the men and Tad Sobber
the night before, and Tad Sobber had come back
for Mrs. Sobber just about the time the Rovers
tried to get into the house.</p>
<p>The story was told with such simpleness that
Dick felt bound to believe it, and consequently he
saw no reason for blaming Oliver Mason, who
was, in truth, on the verge of second childhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must look around and see if those scamps
left anything behind,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t
object to that, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; cried the old man. &ldquo;Only please
do not take any of my few belongings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not take anything, sir, you can trust me
absolutely,&rdquo; answered Dick, readily.</p>
<p>He made a search of the rooms, and especially
the apartments occupied by Mrs. Stanhope and
her abductors. At first he found little of value,
although he picked up a handkerchief that had
Mrs. Stanhope&rsquo;s initials embroidered in the corner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is proof positive that she was here,&rdquo; he
thought grimly.</p>
<p>In one of the fireplaces he came across some
half-burnt letters. He looked them over with
care and caught the post-mark, Portland, Me.
On one slip he read the following:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">easy from Portla</p>
<p class="t">the schooner <i>Mary Del</i></p>
<p class="t2">as we arrive, I will have</p>
<p class="t3">if not then Slay&rsquo;s Island, where</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! this may prove of value,&rdquo; murmured
Dick to himself, and placed the bit of letter in
his pocket. Then he hunted around the rooms
again, but nothing more came to light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Mrs. Sobber come back?&rdquo; asked the old
man, when Dick went below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be an awful woman, if what you
say is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a criminal, Mr. Mason, and so is that
Tad Sobber. I would advise you to have nothing
more to do with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have a housekeeper,&rdquo; whined the old
man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then hire somebody you are sure is honest,&rdquo;
returned Dick; and a few minutes later he quitted
the house.</p>
<p>On his way to the hotel he met Sam and Tom,
who had looked in vain for the automobile. In
as few words as possible he told his brothers
about what Oliver Mason had said, and of the
finding of the slip of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of it?&rdquo; asked Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they are going to Portland, either by
auto or in a boat,&rdquo; answered Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I think,&rdquo; added Tom. &ldquo;But
we may be mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we go any further, I am going to have
that house watched,&rdquo; went on Dick. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hire a
first-class detective, and then, if Mrs. Sobber or
any of the others come back, we&rsquo;ll have &rsquo;em arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They visited a detective agency, and a man
was put on the case without delay. Then the
Rovers hurried down to the water front, to see
if they could get any trace of Mrs. Stanhope
there.</p>
<p>An hour&rsquo;s tramping produced no results, and
somewhat discouraged, they were on the point of
going to the hotel, to meet Spud, when they saw
an old sailor come from a restaurant close by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Dick, addressing the old tar,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get some information. Did you ever
hear of a schooner in these parts that was called
the <i>Mary Del</i> something or other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mary Del?</i>&rdquo; repeated the old sailor, twisting
his forelock. &ldquo;Oh, I reckon you mean the <i>Mary
Delaway</i>!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Sure, I know her. Didn&rsquo;t
I see her sail for Portland less than an hour ago!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">A CHASE UP THE COAST</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You saw her sail for Portland!&rdquo; cried Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Less than an hour ago?&rdquo; exclaimed Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where from?&rdquo; queried Dick, quickly. &ldquo;Hurry
up and tell me&mdash;it will be money in your
pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Mary Delaway</i> sailed from Cruser&rsquo;s
dock,&rdquo; answered the old sailor. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about
four blocks from here. I can show you the place.
But you can&rsquo;t get aboard, messmates&mdash;she&rsquo;s
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must catch her!&rdquo; ejaculated Dick. &ldquo;No
matter at what cost, we must catch her. How can
we do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we follow her in a motor boat, or a
steam launch?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can follow her in a tug,&rdquo; said the old tar.
&ldquo;But she is out of sight now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where she is going to land in
Portland?&rdquo; asked Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know anybody on board?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know Jack Crumpet. He sailed in the old
<i>Resolute</i> with me. I went to see him&mdash;that&rsquo;s how
I know the <i>Mary Delaway</i> sailed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were on board?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;I saw Jack on the dock. He
said as how the cap&rsquo;n had given orders for nobuddy
to come aboard&mdash;why, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I know,&rdquo; muttered Dick. &ldquo;It was to
keep their villainous doings secret. Who did you
see on the schooner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw several men and two ladies. One lady
looked kind of excited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been Mrs. Stanhope!&rdquo; murmured
Dick. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Let us get
some kind of a boat and follow that schooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rover boys were accustomed to quick action,
and they had supplied themselves with
plenty of ready cash to use in case of emergency.
Consequently, it was an easy matter for them to
pick up a steam tug at one of the docks. The
captain said he would willingly follow up the
<i>Mary Delaway</i> and try to overtake her if he was
paid for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go along?&rdquo; asked Dick, of the old
tar. &ldquo;I want you to aid in picking up that
schooner. You know her by sight. I will pay
you good wages.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve signed articles for a trip to Africy, starting
next week Thursday,&rdquo; answered Larry Dixon,
for such was the sailor&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get you back long before that time,&rdquo;
answered Dick. &ldquo;And pay you a nice salary in
the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m your man, messmate,&rdquo; responded
Larry Dixon.</p>
<p>While the steam tug was getting ready to leave,
Dick called up Spud on the telephone and acquainted
their college chum with what had occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will you be back?&rdquo; asked Spud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Dick. &ldquo;Better not
wait for us. This may prove a long chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope you rescue the lady, get back the
fortune, and land those rascals in jail,&rdquo; said
Spud.</p>
<p>The steam tug carried a crew of six, all good,
strong, hearty fellows. In a few brief words
Dick and his brothers explained to the captain
how matters stood, and Captain Wells promised
to aid them all he could in thwarting the plans of
the evildoers. He was armed, and said he could
lend the Rovers some pistols if they wanted
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon the <i>Mary Delaway</i> will take the
regular route to Portland&mdash;that is, so far as the
wind will allow,&rdquo; said the owner of the tug.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll follow that route just as fast as our steam
will permit. But let me give you a tip. Perhaps
it will be better for you to merely follow &rsquo;em to
Portland, and have them locked up when they
reach that place. If you tackle &rsquo;em on the high
seas they may show fight and get the best of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think that over,&rdquo; answered Dick, slowly.
&ldquo;But meanwhile crowd on all steam and get after
them. Never mind using up your coal&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The docks were soon left behind, and the black
smoke pouring from the funnel told how the fireman
was doing his best to make steam. But it
was now late, and it would soon become a problem,
as to whether it would be advisable to run so
fast during the night. They might pass the
schooner without knowing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave the matter to you, Captain Wells,&rdquo;
said Dick, after talking the matter over with his
brothers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you your regular price for
chartering the tug, and one hundred dollars additional
if we succeed in rescuing Mrs. Stanhope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my level best for you, Mr. Rover,&rdquo; responded
the captain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to my crew.&rdquo; And
he did, promising each man an extra five dollars
if they succeeded in doing what the Rovers desired.
As a consequence every man, including
Larry Dixon, was constantly on the lookout for
the <i>Mary Delaway</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>Inside of an hour Boston Harbor had been
left well behind, and then the bow of the steam
tug was turned up the coast in the direction of
Portland, about a hundred miles distance. The
day was now over and the lights on the tug were
lit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see anything of the <i>Mary Delaway</i> yet,&rdquo;
remarked Larry Dixon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll have
to shut up shop till mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could the schooner reach Portland by that
time?&rdquo; asked Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d be there early in the morning,&rdquo; answered
the old sailor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we had better run for Portland, too,&rdquo;
said Tom. &ldquo;We might hang around outside the
harbor on the watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a clear night, with no moon, but with
countless stars bespangling the heavens. The
boys and some of the others remained on the
watch, although they could see but little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be great if we had a searchlight,&rdquo;
said Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the thing!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t
any, so what&rsquo;s the use of talking about it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well try to get some sleep,&rdquo; said
Captain Wells, about nine o&rsquo;clock. &ldquo;I can call you
if anything turns up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay up a couple of hours yet,&rdquo; answered
Dick, although the excitement of the day
had worn him out.</p>
<p>But not a sight of the schooner was seen, and
one after another the Rover boys laid down to
get a few hours&rsquo; sleep. Captain Wells allowed
them to rest until six o&rsquo;clock. By that time they
were standing around near the entrance to Portland
harbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See anything yet?&rdquo; asked Dick, as he sprang
up from the berth upon which he had been resting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; answered the captain of the tug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think they got here ahead of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, for we have been here for several hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys got up and washed, and then had
breakfast. In the meantime the steam tug cruised
around, and those on board watched eagerly for
a sign of the <i>Mary Delaway</i>.</p>
<p>Thus two hours passed. As the time went by
the three Rovers grew more anxious than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of this, Dick?&rdquo; asked
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to make of it, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me as if they had given us the
slip,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If they didn&rsquo;t come here, where did they go
to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. What did that scrap of paper
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That spoke of Slay&rsquo;s Island. But none of the
men on this tug ever heard of such a place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not to be wondered at, Dick,&rdquo; went on
Sam. &ldquo;I understand there are scores of islands
in Casco Bay. It isn&rsquo;t likely these men from
Boston would know the names of all of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They remained around the entrance to Portland
harbor until noon and then Dick ordered the
captain to run in and land them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might go up and down the docks a bit,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;They might have slipped us after all.&rdquo;
They entered the harbor, passing the old lighthouse,
and soon were within easy reach of the
docks. They looked on all sides for the <i>Mary
Delaway</i>, but in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have missed her!&rdquo; groaned Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do next?&rdquo; questioned
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See if I can&rsquo;t find out in some way where the
schooner went to&mdash;and also find out where Slay&rsquo;s
Island is located.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might get a map of Casco Bay. That
would have the names of the islands on it,&rdquo; suggested
Sam. &ldquo;I know there are a great many of
&rsquo;em, some of &rsquo;em quite small and others very
large.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>At last they started to go ashore. They ran
up to a dock where the tug was in the habit of
landing when at Portland, and the boys walked
to the gangplank that was put out for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! look!&rdquo; cried Tom, suddenly, and pointed
to a motor boat lying alongside the steam tug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; gasped Sam.</p>
<p>The motor boat was a craft of fair size, and
very gaudily painted, in red, blue and yellow. It
was piled high with suit-cases, bundles and fishing
outfits. At the wheel was a tall young man,
smoking a cigarette&mdash;a stranger to the Rovers.
In the bow, also smoking, were two other young
men, Jerry Koswell and Bart Larkspur.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">ABOARD THE MARY DELAWAY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on there, you!&rdquo; bawled Jerry Koswell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s the Rovers!&rdquo; ejaculated Bart Larkspur.
&ldquo;How did they get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are following us, that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo; stormed
Koswell. &ldquo;And I won&rsquo;t have it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; asked Dick, as he walked
to the end of the tug nearest to the motor boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know what right you&rsquo;ve got to follow
us?&rdquo; returned Jerry Koswell, sourly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said we were following you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know you are. Didn&rsquo;t you follow us to
Boston, too? I want to know what it means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it means that we are going to have you
arrested,&rdquo; put in Tom, with a side wink at his
brothers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrested!&rdquo; gasped Larkspur, and turned pale.
&ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to stop following us,&rdquo; went on
Koswell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead&mdash;don&rsquo;t talk to them any more!&rdquo;
whispered Larkspur, uneasily. &ldquo;Let us get away
as soon as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid,&rdquo; answered Koswell, boastfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they may have us locked up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row about?&rdquo; asked the young man
who was at the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was a row we had at college, Alf.
Those fellows were in the wrong, but they made
the Head believe otherwise, and we had to&mdash;er&mdash;resign,&rdquo;
answered Jerry Koswell. &ldquo;Well, go
ahead, if you want to,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked Tom, as the
motor boat commenced to move from the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are bound for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell them, Alf!&rdquo; begged Larkspur. &ldquo;Go
ahead&mdash;let&rsquo;s get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t tell us where you are going&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
began Sam, when Dick stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them go&mdash;we haven&rsquo;t time to bother with
them now,&rdquo; said the eldest Rover boy. &ldquo;We have
other fish to fry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you say, Dick. But we ought to scare the
wits out of them if nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it&mdash;some day,&rdquo; put in Tom.</p>
<p>As the motor boat swept past they saw that
the craft was named the <i>Magnet</i>. Soon some
other boats coming in hid it from view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>On going ashore, the Rover boys made diligent
inquiries concerning the <i>Mary Delaway</i> and
at last learned that the schooner was expected by
a certain transportation company some time that
afternoon, to take on a cargo of lumber for Newark,
New Jersey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what we can do excepting to
wait,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go down the harbor to meet the
schooner,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Then Sobber and Crabtree
and the others won&rsquo;t have any chance to land
in secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;ll try to land here, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly Tom, I don&rsquo;t. It is more than likely
the captain of the schooner will land that crowd on
some island before he comes into Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slay&rsquo;s Island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;if there really is such a place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The steam tug left the dock and ran down to the
neighborhood of Portland Light. Here they
cruised around for nearly two hours, when old
Larry Dixon gave a shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see her! I see her! There&rsquo;s the <i>Mary Delaway</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked the three Rovers, excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; And the old sailor pointed with his
hand. &ldquo;I know her by the two patches on her
mainsail and the slit in her jib.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>The steam tug was headed in the direction of
the incoming schooner, and before long the two
craft were within hailing distance of each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aboard the schooner!&rdquo; cried Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aboard the tug!&rdquo; was the answering hail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to talk to the captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the captain. What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to lay-to and let me come on
board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a hurry,&rdquo; snapped the captain of the
<i>Mary Delaway</i>, and the Rovers saw that he was
a hard looking individual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can suit yourself, Captain. But if you
don&rsquo;t let me come on board I&rsquo;ll have you placed
under arrest as soon as you reach your dock,&rdquo;
said Dick, in the sternest voice he could command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrest!&rdquo; roared the master of the schooner.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you talk like that to me, you young whipper-snapper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will talk like that to you&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll do just
what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have me arrested! You must be joking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know well enough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly I don&rsquo;t. You have made some mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to stop and let me come on
board, or not?&rdquo; went on Dick, as calmly as he
could. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s arrest and nothing less.
You can take your choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about,&rdquo;
growled the captain. &ldquo;But I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to
let you come aboard, to avoid worse trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The schooner was brought around, and not
without difficulty Dick leaped aboard, followed
by Tom and Sam. The captain of the schooner
when he saw that they were only young men,
glared savagely at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, explain yourselves!&rdquo; he snapped,
shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know what you have done with Mrs.
Stanhope?&rdquo; said Dick, thinking it best to come
directly to the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Stanhope? Who is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady who was abducted by Tad Sobber
and Josiah Crabtree and taken on your schooner
at Boston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heard of any of the people you are
talking about, young man. You have got hold of
the wrong boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, there is no mistake. You left Boston
yesterday afternoon, and you had on board Mrs.
Stanhope and her abductors. I guess you are old
enough to know what the punishment is for abduction,&rdquo;
went on Dick, pointedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abduction? I ain&rsquo;t abducted nobody, I tell
you. You&rsquo;ve got hold of the wrong boat. You
can search us if you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t suppose the lady is on board now.
I want to know what you did with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know her&mdash;never saw her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You took her on board, and you were seen
doing it,&rdquo; put in Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen!&rdquo; cried the captain, and gave a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; put in Sam. &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve got you dead
to rights, and the best thing you can do is to tell
us at once where she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said the master of the schooner, slowly
and thoughtfully. &ldquo;You tell me the particulars of
this matter and maybe I can put you on the track
of something. I never heard of any lady being
abducted.&rdquo; He saw that he was cornered and
that if arrested matters might go very hard with
him.</p>
<p>In a few words Dick and his brothers told about
how the Stanhope fortune had been stolen and
how the lady herself had been abducted and taken
to Boston. Then they said they had positive
proof that the lady had been taken aboard the
<i>Mary Delaway</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the proof?&rdquo; asked the captain, and
now his voice was not as steady as it had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for one thing, there is a sailor on the
tug who saw the lady on your vessel,&rdquo; said Dick.
&ldquo;In the second place I&rsquo;ve got a letter, written by
one of those rascals, and naming your boat&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Did any of those lunkheads write it
down in a letter?&rdquo; roared the captain. &ldquo;If they
did&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he stopped, in great confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, so you admit the crime, do you?&rdquo; said
Dick, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t admit no crime!&rdquo; growled the
captain of the schooner. &ldquo;I promised to do a little
job for two gentleman, that&rsquo;s all&mdash;and I did it&mdash;and
got paid for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the job to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I tell you, you won&rsquo;t try to drag me into it,
will you?&rdquo; was the anxious question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t tell us, you&rsquo;ll surely go to jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there was anything wrong, honest
I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;leastwise at the start, although I had
some suspicions later. That feller Sobber and
the old gent, Crabtree, along with a Mrs. Sobber,
said they had an aunt who was a bit insane, and
they wanted to take her to an island up here in
Casco Bay, for rest and medical treatment. They
hired me to do the job, and paid me well for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you took them to the island?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What island?&rdquo; asked all of the Rover boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A place called Chesoque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chesoque?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The old lobster catchers used to call it
Shay&rsquo;s Island, after old Cap&rsquo;n Shay, of the lobster
fleet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small">OUT ON CASCO BAY</span></h2>
<p>The Rover boys listened with close attention to
the statement made by the captain of the schooner
and they felt that the fellow was now telling the
truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say you suspected that all wasn&rsquo;t square?&rdquo;
said Dick, after a pause. &ldquo;What made you do
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;the way the lady acted. She
seemed to be more scared than crazy. But they
kept her down in the cabin, so I didn&rsquo;t see much
of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you land the crowd on the island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About nine o&rsquo;clock this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you going back there later?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they said it wouldn&rsquo;t be necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick walked to the rail of the schooner and
beckoned to the captain of the steam tug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This captain says he landed the crowd on
Chesoque Island,&rdquo; he called out. &ldquo;Do you know
where that is?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know where she is,&rdquo; put in Larry Dixon, as
Captain Wells hesitated in thought. &ldquo;The lobster
catchers used to have a hangout there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; asked Captain Wells, and the
old tar described its location as well as he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon I could pick it up, from what the man
says,&rdquo; said the captain of the tug, to Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right then,&rdquo; answered the eldest Rover.
He turned again to the captain of the schooner.
&ldquo;Now listen to me. I know you and I know your
boat. If you have told me the exact truth, well
and good. If you haven&rsquo;t&mdash;well, you&rsquo;ll have to
take the consequences, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t abduct nobody. I only did a job and
got paid for it,&rdquo; muttered the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you bound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to&mdash;er&mdash;take a load of lumber down
to Newark, New Jersey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well&mdash;then we&rsquo;ll know where to locate
you. Come on!&rdquo; added Dick to his brothers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can rely on me,&rdquo; said the captain, and
spoke quite respectfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell all I know, and
so will my men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Jack!&rdquo; cried Larry Dixon to a sailor on
the schooner, and the fellow addressed waved his
hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to that man a minute,&rdquo; said Dick, to
the captain. The latter wished to demur, but
Dick gave him no chance. The fellow was told
to go aboard the tug, and there Larry Dixon asked
him to tell his story. The sailor had little, however,
to add to what his captain had said, excepting
that the landing at Chesoque Island had been
made in something of a hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a dollar for you,&rdquo; said Dick, on parting.
&ldquo;Whenever the schooner makes a landing
anywhere, you send me word where she is,&rdquo; and
he gave the tar his home address and also the address
of a hotel in Portland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to get me into trouble and I&rsquo;ll tell
you everything I know!&rdquo; shouted the captain of
the schooner, as the steam tug went on its way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember you!&rdquo; answered Dick, somewhat
grimly. He did not know whether he could trust
the captain or not.</p>
<p>Leaving the entrance to Portland Harbor, the
tug steamed up into the waters of Casco Bay, that
beautiful spot with its scores of verdant and rocky
islands. As it was the height of the summer season
they passed many pleasure boats, big and little.
Once they passed an island where a big picnic was
in progress and they heard the music from a
band quite distinctly. They also passed Peak&rsquo;s
Island where there was a big, round-topped
structure, which the captain of the tug said was
a famous summer theater.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A fellow could certainly have a dandy time
here, cruising around among the islands,&rdquo; was
Tom&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>From Larry Dixon the boys learned that Chesoque
Island was away from most of the others,
lying far out in the Bay. It was a rocky place,
and there was a story that once a band of smugglers
had used it for a rendezvous. It was also
said to be inhabited by numerous snakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, but I don&rsquo;t want to run up against
any snakes,&rdquo; said Sam, shuddering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; added Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No snakes shall stop me from trying to locate
Mrs. Stanhope,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;More than likely the
story about snakes has little foundation to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the story about the snakes back of Putnam
Hall,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Old Farmer Landell said
there were thousands of &rsquo;em, and he and his son
killed exactly five, and only little ones at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently a distant shore loomed up and after
an examination Larry Dixon declared it was the
island for which they were seeking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; questioned Dick. &ldquo;This is
very important, and we don&rsquo;t want to make any
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know the spot,&rdquo; answered the old tar. &ldquo;See
that old building? The lobster catchers used to
use that. And see that rock? There is where the
old <i>John Spurr</i> struck, in a storm one winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want to strike anything,&rdquo; said
Captain Wells, and ordered the engineer to reduce
speed. Then, with great caution, they approached
what had once been a good dock, but one which
was now practically in ruins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, there&rsquo;s a motor boat!&rdquo; cried Sam, as
they came closer. Then all looked and saw that
a gaudily-painted motor boat was tied up on one
side of the old dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that looks like the motor boat Koswell,
Larkspur and that stranger had!&rdquo; ejaculated Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the same!&rdquo; shouted Tom. &ldquo;There is the
name, <i>Magnet</i>. Now what do you think of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I think?&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;I think they
must be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Sobber and the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. I didn&rsquo;t think they
knew Sobber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the steam tug drew up on the other side of
the dilapidated dock, those on board saw three
persons rush from the old building nearby. They
were Koswell, Larkspur and the fellow who had
been running the motor boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I won&rsquo;t have this!&rdquo; roared Koswell.
&ldquo;You get out of here, and be quick about it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we stop &rsquo;em from landing?&rdquo; asked Larkspur.
He was plainly scared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t land here!&rdquo; called out the young
man who had run the <i>Magnet</i>. &ldquo;This is private
property. I forbid you coming in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Private property?&rdquo; called out Captain Wells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I said.&rdquo; And now the young
man turned to his companions and a whispered,
but animated conversation ensued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Alfred Darkingham. This island belongs
to my uncle, John Darkingham. He gave
us permission to come camping here, and said we
needn&rsquo;t let anybody else come ashore. I forbid
your making a landing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to talk, Alf!&rdquo; cried Koswell, in
a low, but earnest voice. &ldquo;Make &rsquo;em stay away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em come ashore!&rdquo; added
Larkspur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Darkingham, I&rsquo;d like to talk to you,&rdquo; said
Dick, as the steam tug bumped against the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you listen to him, Alf!&rdquo; cried Koswell.
&ldquo;He only came to make trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make him go right away,&rdquo; added Larkspur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to leave,&rdquo; ordered Alfred Darkingham.
Evidently he was a close crony to the
boys who had run away from Brill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want to ask you a few questions,&rdquo; pursued
Dick, firmly. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll not go away until you
answer them&mdash;and maybe not then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is private property, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said that before. What I want to know
is, Do you know the other persons on this island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no other persons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe otherwise. A lady has been abducted,
and I have every reason to believe she was taken
to this island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody here. I was here yesterday, and all
of last week, and I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they brought the lady here this morning,
about nine o&rsquo;clock. I&rsquo;d like to search the
island for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trick!&rdquo; cried Larkspur. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trick to
get ashore and play us foul! Don&rsquo;t you let &rsquo;em
land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nobody on this island but ourselves,&rdquo;
said Alfred Darkingham. &ldquo;You can take my
word for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you let me make a search?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not. I want you to go away, and at
once. This is private property, and if you try to
land I&rsquo;ll have the law on you!&rdquo; And as he spoke
the young man looked not only at the Rovers but
also at the captain of the steam tug.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV
<br /><span class="small">ON CHESOQUE ISLAND</span></h2>
<p>For a moment there was silence. Dick looked
at Alfred Darkingham and then at Captain Wells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of this?&rdquo; he asked of the
captain of the tug.</p>
<p>The captain shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do as you think best, Mr. Rover,&rdquo; he
said slowly. &ldquo;He can certainly have us arrested
if we land without permission. And the authorities
have been pretty strict lately&mdash;so many folks
landing where they hadn&rsquo;t any business to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if Mrs. Stanhope is here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says there is nobody but his crowd on the
island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may be in hiding,&rdquo; suggested Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they are, they&rsquo;ll take good care to keep out
of your way&mdash;if such a thing is possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us leave!&rdquo; put in Sam, in a low voice.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a plan that may bring results.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you as soon as we are out of hearing,&rdquo;
returned the youngest Rover.</p>
<p>The steam tug was backed away from the dock.
Koswell and Larkspur grinned in triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think of coming back!&rdquo; shouted
Koswell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do, remember we are armed,&rdquo; added
Larkspur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll remember what you have done&mdash;don&rsquo;t
forget that,&rdquo; answered Dick, with some bitterness.
It worried him greatly to have the search for Mrs.
Stanhope delayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what is your plan?&rdquo; asked Tom of Sam,
as soon as they were a goodly distance from the
island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I propose we sail away and pretend to be
going back to Portland. Then we can turn and
come up on the other side of the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll watch for us,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might land at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we could do that. But if we wait, we
may be losing valuable time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run for the next island and sail around
that,&rdquo; said Captain Wells. &ldquo;That may throw
them off the scent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>It took the best part of half an hour to gain the
next island and round a convenient point. Here
the tug was stopped, that they might decide on
their next move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on, let&rsquo;s do something!&rdquo; cried Tom.
&ldquo;Let us sail for the other side of that island and
chance it! If they come after us, we can easily
steam away again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was decided, and rounding the island
they were at, they set a new course, so that they
might reach Chesoque Island at a point directly
opposite to where the dock was located. In the
middle of the island were several rocky hills, so
that the view from one side to the other was completely
shut off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to be careful here,&rdquo; said Captain
Wells, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford to strike on the rocks.
Those chaps would let us drown before they
would come to our assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The steam tug came in slowly. It could not
reach the island proper, but stopped at the first of
a series of rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have one of those pistols,&rdquo; said Dick,
to the captain, and the weapon was handed over.
Then Tom and Sam also armed themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better stand off,&rdquo; went on Dick to
Captain Wells. &ldquo;If we want you we&rsquo;ll fire three
shots, or wave a handkerchief.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, don&rsquo;t you want me along?&rdquo; asked Larry
Dixon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like a scrap, if it comes to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along if you want to,&rdquo; answered Dick.
He saw that though the sailor was old he was
strong, and not afraid to take his own part.</p>
<p>The boys and the tar lost no time in jumping
from one rock to another until the main portion
of the island was gained. Then they ran for the
shelter of some bushes. In the meantime the
steam tug moved away to such a distance that
those aboard could be seen with difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if the others didn&rsquo;t see us land, we are
all right,&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to make any noise,&rdquo; cautioned
Dick. &ldquo;Remember, they may be on the watch for
us&mdash;Koswell and his cronies, and the Sobber
crowd too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Koswell and Larkspur would
give aid to those other rascals?&rdquo; asked Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;d do almost anything to make
trouble for us, Sam. You can see how bitter they
acted at the dock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With caution the party of four began a tour of
the island. They moved from the shelter of the
bushes to a thicket of pines, and then climbed
along a ridge of rough rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll crawl to the top,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll
have a pretty good chance to look around.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>At the top of the ridge, however, he found the
view somewhat disappointing. There were other
ridges, and several thickets of pines and hemlocks,
and at one point what looked to be a cliff with
some caves beneath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will take some time to explore this island,&rdquo;
said he, as he came down. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder that
the smugglers used to use it. It&rsquo;s got a number of
dandy hiding places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the world did the Sobber crowd learn
of it?&rdquo; asked Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can answer that,&rdquo; said Tom &ldquo;Josiah
Crabtree once taught in a Portland school and he
used to put in his summers on an island in this
bay. More than likely, in cruising around, he
heard of this island, and when he plotted to abduct
Mrs. Stanhope he made up his mind it would
be just the spot to bring her to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All providing she is here,&rdquo; added Sam. &ldquo;We
haven&rsquo;t proved that yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They moved on, and passed another ridge of
rocks. Then they came to a well-defined trail,
running from one end of the island to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us follow this,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;If there are
any buildings near the centre of the island they&rsquo;ll
likely be on this road.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a spring!&rdquo; exclaimed Sam, a minute
later. &ldquo;Say, that water looks good. I am going
to have a drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All stopped to quench their thirst, for the day
had been warm in spite of the breeze that was
blowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried Dick, as he pointed at the wet
ground. &ldquo;Somebody has been here before us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; returned Tom. &ldquo;Now, if we were
only Indians, we would know whose footprints
those were and would follow &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sam got down to examine the footprints.
The majority of them were of good size,
but a few were small, the heel marks especially so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe those marks were made by a woman&rsquo;s
shoes!&rdquo; murmured Dick. &ldquo;And if so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were made by Mrs. Stanhope!&rdquo; finished
Sam. &ldquo;Dick, I think we&rsquo;ve struck the right trail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This proves that what that young fellow of the
motor boat said was not true,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Other
folks are on this island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us follow up the footmarks!&rdquo; cried Larry
Dixon. &ldquo;Come on, messmates, to the rescue!&rdquo;
And he waved a stick he had picked up.</p>
<p>To follow up the footmarks was not easy, for
they led from the dirt to the path and then to
some smooth rocks. But they managed to get the
general direction, which was something.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if it would do any good to set up a
yell,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Maybe Mrs. Stanhope would
hear it, and answer it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she got the chance.&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;If she
didn&rsquo;t, all the yelling would do would be to let our
enemies know we were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we had better go ahead as quietly as we
can,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;If possible, we want to take
them unawares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much to their surprise, at the other side of the
smooth rocks was another path, running between
a thick growth of pines. Here the going was
somewhat uncertain, and they had to proceed
slowly, for fear of stepping into a crevice and
twisting an ankle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they brought Mrs. Stanhope this way, it
must have been very hard on her,&rdquo; murmured
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; exclaimed Sam, suddenly, and held
up his hand.</p>
<p>All became silent, and listened with strained
ears. But the only sounds that reached them was
the breeze through the trees, and the washing of
the waves on the rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it, Sam?&rdquo; asked Dick, in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard a call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have been mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I was, but&mdash;There it goes again!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom. &ldquo;Somebody is
calling from the other side of this patch of trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Jerry Koswell,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he calling to?&rdquo; asked Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Keep still and maybe we&rsquo;ll find
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then all listened with bated breath for what
might follow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><span class="small">A TALK OF IMPORTANCE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I say, you on the rocks! Come down here
and let us talk to you!&rdquo; shouted Jerry Koswell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you. What do you want?&rdquo; asked a
voice that was strange to the Rovers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to know what you are doing on this
island?&rdquo; demanded another person, Alfred Darkingham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What business is it of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What business?&rdquo; shouted Darkingham, wrathfully.
&ldquo;A good deal of my business. This island
belongs to my uncle and you have no right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that so!&rdquo; exclaimed the stranger. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know that this island belonged to anybody
in particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it does. Who are you anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my name is of no account, since we are
not acquainted,&rdquo; answered the stranger. &ldquo;If this
is your island, I suppose the only thing for me to
do is to get off of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;only looking around,&rdquo; stammered
the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see that I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo; asked Larkspur, who
had come up. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see you land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I came in a&mdash;er&mdash;in a motor boat, run by
a friend of mine. He&mdash;er&mdash;he said he would call
for me later,&rdquo; stammered the stranger.</p>
<p>The Rover boys listened to this conversation
with interest, and gradually drew closer, as the
stranger came from the rocks to talk to Darkingham
and the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, are you the fellow who abducted a lady!&rdquo;
cried Larkspur.</p>
<p>At this direct question the stranger started.
&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;what makes you ask&mdash;er&mdash;that
question?&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know some fellows who are looking for a
lady who was abducted&mdash;at least, that is the story
they told,&rdquo; answered Koswell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you see those fellows?&rdquo; asked the
stranger, and now he was plainly excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were here awhile ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;on this island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the dock&mdash;but they didn&rsquo;t land&mdash;we didn&rsquo;t
let &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Larkspur.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; The stranger was thoughtful for a
moment. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know anything about a
lady who was abducted,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I am
just roaming around a bit. As soon as my friend
comes back with the motor boat I&rsquo;ll leave the
island. If I had known it was private property I
shouldn&rsquo;t have come ashore at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind a fellow roaming around a
little,&rdquo; said Alfred Darkingham, loftily. &ldquo;But
we came here to camp out, and of course we prefer
to have the island to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Well&mdash;er&mdash;I shan&rsquo;t disturb you. I&mdash;er&mdash;left
my fishing outfit on the opposite shore.
I&rsquo;ll go and get it, and then I&rsquo;ll be ready to leave
as soon as my friend comes for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t be in such a tremendous hurry,
Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smith&mdash;plain John Smith,&rdquo; filled in the
stranger. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stopping at Peak&rsquo;s Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Alfred Darkingham. These are
my friends, Jerry Koswell and Bart Larkspur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Koswell!&rdquo; cried the stranger, in considerable
surprise. &ldquo;Did you say Jerry Koswell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you&mdash;were you a student at Brill College?&rdquo;
asked the man who had given his name as
John Smith.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t remember
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, for you never met me. But I have heard
of you, and I think I have heard of your friend,
Mr. Larkspur. Didn&rsquo;t you once have some
trouble with some fellow students named Rover?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Larkspur, and his brow darkened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty bad trouble, too, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad enough,&rdquo; growled Koswell. &ldquo;Are you a
friend to the Rovers?&rdquo; he added, suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I don&rsquo;t know them. But I heard of
the trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the Rovers&rsquo; fault,&rdquo; said Jerry Koswell,
sourly. &ldquo;They put it off on us, but they
were to blame. We might have gone back to Brill,
but we didn&rsquo;t think it was worth while; did we,
Bart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we had enough of the grind as it was,&rdquo;
answered Larkspur, glibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott! just listen to that!&rdquo; whispered
Tom to his brothers. They were behind some
nearby bushes and could catch every word that
was spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! or they may hear you,&rdquo; was the warning,
from Dick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you once get a letter or two from a
party named Tad Sobber?&rdquo; went on the fellow
who called himself John Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did!&rdquo; cried Jerry Koswell. &ldquo;Then you know
Sobber?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing I told you that I did?&rdquo; And the
strange man eyed Koswell narrowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sobber wanted me to help him get square on
the Rovers,&rdquo; went on Jerry Koswell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t want to help him, is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did want to help him. I sent him a
long letter to that effect, but he never answered
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A letter that you would help Sobber?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. The Rovers treated me dirt mean, and
I&rsquo;d go out of my way a good deal to get square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I!&rdquo; cried Larkspur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Sobber ever got your letter,&rdquo;
went on the stranger. &ldquo;He told me he had waited
to hear from you but you hadn&rsquo;t answered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the letter got lost,&rdquo; answered Jerry Koswell.
&ldquo;I am sorry if it did, for I wanted to fix the
Rovers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so did I,&rdquo; echoed Larkspur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe you can fix them yet,&rdquo; went on
the fellow who had called himself John Smith.
&ldquo;You say you are going to camp out here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I may see you again in the near future.
I am going to Peak&rsquo;s Island and then to Portland,
and I may see Tad Sobber, and if I do, I&rsquo;ll tell him
what you&rsquo;ve said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it!&rdquo; cried Koswell promptly. &ldquo;And tell
him I am willing to help him all I can against the
Rovers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And tell him that Bart Larkspur will help him,
too,&rdquo; supplemented that individual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered the stranger. &ldquo;Of course
you know it might be a&mdash;er&mdash;a little risky, getting
the best of those Rovers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll take a little risk,&rdquo; answered Koswell.
&ldquo;But, say!&rdquo; he almost shouted. &ldquo;I begin to
smell a mouse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the Rovers who were here&mdash;looking
for that lady who was abducted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you and Sobber bring her here? Is she
here now?&rdquo; went on Koswell, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If&mdash;er&mdash;if Sobber was here, would you like to
meet him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I would. And the lady who was abducted&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you anything about her. But&mdash;well,
I might as well admit it&mdash;Tad Sobber is on
this island with me. He&mdash;er&mdash;he came on rather
a peculiar errand and he didn&rsquo;t want anybody to
know it. But I rather think, as you are going to
camp out here, he would like to meet you and
talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up the shore a distance. If you&rsquo;ll wait for me
here I&rsquo;ll hunt him up and bring him to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring him down to our camp yonder,&rdquo; put in
Alfred Darkingham. &ldquo;We are going down there
to get something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll bring him to your camp just as
soon as I can locate him. We&rsquo;ll be there in less
than an hour. So long!&rdquo; And with a wave of
his hand, the stranger turned and hurried across
the rocks and into the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know that man!&rdquo; whispered Sam,
excitedly. &ldquo;His name is Pally, Jim Pally. He
was one of the freight thieves who was in league
with Sid Merrick and Tad Sobber. He got away
when the gang was rounded up,&rdquo; he added, referring
to a happening, the particulars of which were
related in &ldquo;The Rover Boys on the Farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now he is aiding Sobber again,&rdquo; said
Tom. &ldquo;Maybe he is the fellow who helped in carrying
Mrs. Stanhope off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think he is the rascal who got the fortune at
the lumber company office,&rdquo; whispered Dick.
&ldquo;His appearance tallies with the description Mrs.
Stanhope left. Come on, let us follow him. I
think he will lead us directly to where Sobber and
Crabtree are, and Mrs. Sobber and Mrs. Stanhope,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Dick led the way with the others at his
heels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><span class="small">WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CAVE</span></h2>
<p>The man ahead hurried along over the rocks so
quickly that the Rovers and Larry Dixon had
difficulty in keeping up with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bird for moving,&rdquo; was the old sailor&rsquo;s
comment. &ldquo;Splice my main brace! but I wish he&rsquo;d
put a reef or two in his legs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man ahead suddenly made a turn around
some rocks. The boys and the tar followed cautiously,
so as not to be surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait here, I&rsquo;ll look ahead and investigate,&rdquo;
said Dick. And he shoved some bushes aside.</p>
<p>A surprise awaited him&mdash;but not of the sort he
had anticipated. The man had disappeared!</p>
<p>Vainly did Dick look in all directions for him.
He was as completely gone as if the earth had
opened and swallowed him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can he have entered some opening in the
rocks?&rdquo; the youth asked himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>With added caution he moved forward a few
steps further. Then, between some dense bushes,
he saw a slit in some high rocks. The slit was irregular
in shape but not over a foot wide in any
one place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; asked Tom, who, growing
impatient, had followed his big brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to have disappeared, Tom,&rdquo; was the
low reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he go in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just what I was wondering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick looked into the slit. It was of uncertain
depth and looked dark and uninviting. Then the
whole crowd searched the neighborhood. Not a
trace of the stranger was discernable anywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he didn&rsquo;t fly up in the air,&rdquo; said Sam.
&ldquo;He must have gone somewhere. Why not look
into that opening, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look out that you don&rsquo;t get shot!&rdquo; warned
Tom. &ldquo;That fellow, if he is one of the old freight
thieves and the rascal who robbed Mrs. Stanhope
of the valise with the fortune, must be a desperate
character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I go in, it will be pistol first,&rdquo; answered
Dick, grimly.</p>
<p>He drew the weapon Captain Wells had loaned
him, and slowly but cautiously wormed his way
between the rocks. It was so dark he had to feel
his way along, and, fearing that he might fall into
some hole, he did not advance a step until he was
sure of his footing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we come?&rdquo; called Tom, softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; answered Dick.</p>
<p>He passed along a distance of fifteen or twenty
feet. Then the passageway widened, and he
found himself standing on a rocky flooring that
was comparatively smooth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious! can this be one of the entrances to
the smugglers&rsquo; cave they told about?&rdquo; he mused.</p>
<p>He continued to advance, and presently caught
sight of a flicker of light, playing over the uneven
rocks that formed the roof of the cavern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must come from a campfire!&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;And if it does. I must have struck the
right spot. Maybe this is where they are holding
Dora&rsquo;s mother a prisoner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued to go forward, and the light of
the fire grew brighter. Then of a sudden, he
heard a step behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will spy on me, will you!&rdquo; cried a voice, vindictively,
and in a trice he was struck a blow on
the back of the head. He went down in a heap,
and a man leaped on top of him and held him
fast. Then commenced a fierce struggle, in the
midst of which Dick&rsquo;s pistol went off, making a
tremendous report in that confined space. The
bullet struck the rocks, doing no damage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>The pistol had been close to Dick&rsquo;s head and
the discharge caused the smoke to get into his
face, choking and blinding him. Then he received
another blow, and for a minute or two
knew no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; cried Tom, as the pistol went off.
&ldquo;Dick must be in trouble! Come on, Sam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but be careful,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want me?&rdquo; asked the old tar, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better stay on guard here, for the
present,&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you say, messmate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom wormed his way between the rocks and
Sam followed. The pistol shot was followed by
silence, and the two Rover boys did not know
what to make of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I call?&rdquo; asked Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well,&rdquo; was Tom&rsquo;s reply, and both
called Dick&rsquo;s name as loudly as they could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; came back faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are coming!&rdquo; yelled Tom, rushing forward.
&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; was the answer, and then of a
sudden all became quiet again, as a hand was
placed over Dick&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>With their weapons ready for use, Tom and
Sam ran through the cavern. But all was silent,
and the flickering rays from the campfire beyond
were too faint for them to see much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick! Dick! Where are you?&rdquo; called out
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the left!&rdquo; was the faint reply. &ldquo;Turn to
the left!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice sounded muffled, as if the speaker
was being strangled, and with their hearts in their
throats, Tom and Sam advanced and at a break
in the rocky wall, turned to the left. Hardly had
they gone a dozen steps when they plunged downward
into space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; came from both, and then followed a
mighty splash, as the pair struck the water. Each
went down over his head, and on coming up had
to strike out to keep from drowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam! Sam!&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; was the spluttered-out reply. &ldquo;Are
you hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, but I went over my head in water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can he be drowned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was pitch dark, and only by calling to each
other did the two lads manage to get together.
Both swam around until their feet touched a rock
and on this they stood to catch their breath. The
water was all around them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Which way did we come, Tom?&rdquo; asked Sam,
after a moment of silence, during which both did
what they could to get back their breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t see a thing, can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Dick is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I, Tom. I believe somebody fooled
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! And we fell right into the trap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where can Dick be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely a prisoner of our enemies,&rdquo; muttered
Tom, bitterly.</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s surmise was correct, Dick was indeed a
prisoner of their enemies. He had his hands and
his feet bound tightly, and he had been dragged,
by Tad Sobber towards the campfire that was
burning at the further end of the big cave. In
the meantime the fellow who had been followed
by Dick went off to make sure that Tom and Sam
would turn to the left and fall into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dick Rover, this is what you get for
following us!&rdquo; cried Tad Sobber, in tones of
triumph. &ldquo;Perhaps, some day, you&rsquo;ll learn enough
to keep your hands out of my affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sobber, tell me, what have you done with Mrs.
Stanhope?&rdquo; asked Dick, quickly. Even though he
felt bruised and shook up, the welfare of Dora&rsquo;s
mother was uppermost in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not here to answer your questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you realize that you and Josiah Crabtree
have committed a big crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have done nothing wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you call stealing and abducting wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t stolen anything. The fortune from
Treasure Isle belonged to my uncle and me&mdash;the
Stanhopes had no right to it whatsoever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think otherwise&mdash;and so did the courts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! Your side didn&rsquo;t treat me fairly, you
bought up the judges! I know you!&rdquo; stormed
Tab Sobber. &ldquo;The fortune was ours! Now I&rsquo;ve
got it&mdash;and I mean to keep it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of Mrs. Stanhope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Stanhope has acted like a sensible
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Acted like a sensible woman? What do you
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has done what she should have done years
ago&mdash;she has given her heart to the man who
loves her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sobber, you don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Dick could not
go on, for the lump that came into his throat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do mean it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that she has become the wife of Mr.
Josiah Crabtree!&rdquo; cried Tad Sobber. &ldquo;So if you
ever marry Dora Stanhope you&rsquo;ll have Mr. Crabtree
for your father-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII
<br /><span class="small">AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL</span></h2>
<p>At the announcement of Tad Sobber, Dick
could only stare at the speaker for the time being.</p>
<p>Was it really true that Dora&rsquo;s mother had married
the disreputable Josiah Crabtree after all?
It made his heart sick to think of such a state of
affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are telling me the truth?&rdquo; he asked at
last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you, Tad Sobber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well&mdash;you can ask Mr. Crabtree&mdash;and
Mrs. Stanhope, when you see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she married Crabtree she was forced to do
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she married him willingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never believe it. Where is she now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am not here to answer questions, Dick Rover.
You and your brothers came here I suppose to
get the best of us. Well, you are nicely caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find that out before you are many hours
older,&rdquo; answered Sobber, and turned away.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour went by and the man who
had met Koswell and the others outside of the
cavern came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jim, what about the other Rovers?&rdquo;
questioned Tad Sobber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe enough,&rdquo; answered Jim Pally, with a
grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down in the pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They slipped in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sure did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they won&rsquo;t drown,&rdquo; went on Sobber,
uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they are safe enough. I heard &rsquo;em swimming
around until they found the rocks to stand
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough. Now, what do you think we
had better do with this one?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you make him join his brothers?&rdquo;
answered Jim Pally. And then he motioned Sobber
to one side, out of Dick&rsquo;s hearing. A conversation
in a low tone followed. Pally was telling
Sobber they had better be on guard, since the
Rovers might not be alone. Then he told of the
meeting with Koswell, Larkspur and Darkingham;
and the two went off to consult with Josiah
Crabtree.</p>
<p>Left to himself, Dick tried his best to free himself
of the bonds that held him. But the work of
making him a prisoner had been done well, and
all he did was to cut his wrists and his ankles.</p>
<p>When Sobber and Pally came back they were
accompanied by Josiah Crabtree. The former
teacher and jailbird wore the same dictatorial look
as of yore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! so we meet again, Rover!&rdquo; cried Josiah
Crabtree, pursing up his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree, is it true that you have married
Mrs. Stanhope?&rdquo; asked Dick, bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;er&mdash;we are as good as married, yes,&rdquo;
he stammered, taken somewhat off his guard by
the suddenness of the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As good as married? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean she has promised to be my&mdash;er&mdash;my
bride as soon as we can obtain a&mdash;er&mdash;a minister
to perform the ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are forcing her into this marriage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, young man, not at all! She is going
to marry me of her own free will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! don&rsquo;t dare to talk to me in this fashion,
Rover!&rdquo; stormed Josiah Crabtree, glaring at the
helpless youth before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you let me speak to Mrs. Stanhope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And poison her mind against me? Indeed
not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is in safe hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, in the hands of a very estimable lady, who
is doing all that is possible to make her comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is&mdash;er&mdash;a little bit fatigued by her journey,
that is all. She will be quite herself after she
has rested for a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree, you had no right to abduct her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says I abducted her? She accompanied
me willingly, Rover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe that, and never will believe it.
You mesmerized or hypnotized her, or something
of the sort. I know your tricks of old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! don&rsquo;t dare to talk to me in that fashion!&rdquo;
stormed Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare to do
it!&rdquo; And coming closer he shook his fist in Dick&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d not do that if I were free, Josiah Crabtree!&rdquo;
cried the youth, defiantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, we can&rsquo;t afford to waste time in talk!&rdquo;
interrupted Tad Sobber. &ldquo;I reckon the best thing
we can do with this fellow is to make him join
his brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;&rdquo; went on Crabtree, and finished in
a whisper which Dick did not catch.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Dick was led back into the
cavern towards the pool into which his brothers
had fallen. Sobber carried a torch, that threw a
flickering light throughout the dismal underground
opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; came faintly from the bottom of
the pool, and looking down those on the rocks high
above saw Sam and Tom standing there, in water
up to their knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would be, if we could get out,&rdquo; answered
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! It&rsquo;s the Sobber crowd, with Dick!&rdquo;
murmured Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they are going to aid us,&rdquo; returned
Tom.</p>
<p>A few words passed between Sobber, Crabtree,
and Pally, and then while two of the evildoers
held Dick the third cut his bonds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, you can join your brothers!&rdquo; cried
Sobber, and gave Dick a shove that sent him headlong.
Down he came with a tremendous splash,
and then the waters of the pool closed over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cowards!&rdquo; shouted Tom, in a rage. &ldquo;I
shouldn&rsquo;t treat a dog that way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shut your mouth!&rdquo; yelled back Tad Sobber.
&ldquo;It serves you right&mdash;for following us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day you&rsquo;ll be in jail, Tad Sobber!&rdquo;
shouted Sam. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s where you belong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All waited for Dick to come up, but second
after second passed and the eldest Rover boy
failed to appear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something is wrong!&rdquo; gasped Tom, in alarm.
&ldquo;Maybe his head struck on the bottom,&rdquo; cried
Sam. &ldquo;If he is dead, you&rsquo;ll pay the penalty!&rdquo; he
cried, to those on the shore of the rocky pool.</p>
<p>All were worried, for those above had not expected
anything of this sort to happen. They
looked down, but could see nothing of Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to hunt for him!&rdquo; cried Tom, and
leaving the rocks upon which he was standing, he
swam with all haste in the direction of the spot
where his big brother had gone down. Seeing
this, Sam followed his example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we had better be getting out of here!&rdquo;
muttered Jim Pally, turning pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no! let us see if they bring Dick Rover
up!&rdquo; answered Tad Sobber, hoarsely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>The firebrand was swung into a larger blaze
and the glare cast on the waters. As the rays lit
up the weird scene, Tom set up a sudden shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; demanded Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over yonder! I just saw him bob up. Quick,
Sam, before he goes to the bottom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brothers swam to the spot indicated by
Tom with all possible speed, and Tom made a dive
under the surface. When he came up again he
had hold of Dick&rsquo;s left foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve go&mdash;got him!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Hel&mdash;help
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For reply Sam ranged up by his brother&rsquo;s side,
and between them they raised Dick up and swam
with him to the spot where the water was shallow.
Then they stood there, in water up to their
knees, supporting Dick as best they could. The
oldest Rover boy was all but unconscious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to help us?&rdquo; yelled Tom, to their
enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo; asked Tad
Sobber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I fancy he was only shamming!&rdquo; came
from Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;Come on away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare to leave us here!&rdquo; cried Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help us out,&rdquo; came from Tom. &ldquo;It is your
duty to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; answered Tad Sobber, with a
sneer. &ldquo;You can help yourself&mdash;if you can!&rdquo;
And with these words he walked away, in company
with Crabtree and Pally, leaving the Rovers
to their fate in the water and the darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<h2 id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX
<br /><span class="small">A MINUTE TOO LATE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the rascals!&rdquo; murmured Tom, as the
light faded from sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are the worst!&rdquo; supplemented Sam. And
then he added: &ldquo;How do you feel Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&mdash;I guess I&rsquo;ll come around!&rdquo; murmured
the oldest Rover boy. &ldquo;But I came pretty close to
being drowned!&rdquo; he added, with a shudder. &ldquo;I
struck something and it about stunned me, and I
swallowed a lot of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom and Sam continued to hold up their
brother until Dick had recovered sufficiently to
support himself. As they stood on the submerged
rocks, they listened for some sound from their
enemies, but none came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they have left the cave,&rdquo; suggested
Sam, after ten or fifteen minutes had passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a fierce place,&rdquo; was Tom&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like a great big well!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And we are like the frogs at the bottom of the
well!&rdquo; added Dick, grimly. He felt a little weak,
but otherwise was all right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked around when we had the light of that
torch,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t see any place
where a fellow could climb out, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a spot, Tom,&rdquo; answered Sam. &ldquo;The
walls were all as smooth and as slippery as glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they mean to leave us here to
die?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d be as heartless as all
that,&rdquo; came from Tom. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d be afraid of
consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour went by&mdash;just then it was an age&mdash;and
at last the boys saw a glimmer of light approaching.
It flickered and flared over the walls for
fully a minute and then commenced to fade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody went past, through the main cave!&rdquo;
cried Tom. &ldquo;Wonder who it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sobber crowd most likely,&rdquo; returned
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it might be somebody else!&rdquo; cried Sam.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to yell and find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his voice in a loud call, and Tom and
Dick joined in. Several minutes went by, and
they called again. Then they saw the flickering
of the light once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; came faintly to their ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This way! This way!&rdquo; shouted one Rover
boy after another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful of where you step!&rdquo; cautioned
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way!&rdquo; they answered, and kept calling
until the light of a ship&rsquo;s lantern came into view,
and they saw Captain Wells and Larry Dixon approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; ejaculated the captain of the
steam tug, as he came to a halt on the brink of the
blackish pool. &ldquo;How in the world did you git
down there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help us out first, and then we&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; replied
Dick, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you meet our enemies?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a soul have we met since we landed,&rdquo; answered
the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way did you enter the cave?&rdquo; asked
Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the slit in the rocks&mdash;where you came in,&rdquo;
answered Larry Dixon. &ldquo;I watched you disappear,
and afterwards I heard some yelling. Then
I got scared and ran down to the shore and signalled
for the steam tug to come in. I told the
cap&rsquo;n all I knew, and he came ashore with a lantern
to see what was wrong&mdash;and here we be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come in the nick of time,&rdquo; said Dick.
&ldquo;Our enemies, the Sobber crowd, are here, and
they left us as you see us. I rather think they
have Mrs. Stanhope and that fortune here, too,
but I am not certain. Help to get us out of here,
and we&rsquo;ll get after &rsquo;em without delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know how we are going to help you
without a rope,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw some rope, down in the big part of this
cave,&rdquo; said Larry Dixon. &ldquo;Let me have the light
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll fetch it in a jiffy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the light and was off on the run. When
he returned he was out of breath. In his hands
he held several pieces of good, stout rope, parts
of the same rope which had been used to make
Dick a close prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can splice these,&rdquo; said the old tar, and
while Captain Wells held the lantern, he tied the
bits together. Then both he and the captain allowed
one end of the rope to dangle down into
the hole, while they braced themselves and held
on to the upper portion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it long enough?&rdquo; asked Captain Wells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so&mdash;I&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; cried Tom, and leaving
the rocks he swam over to the rope. He was just
able to reach it, and being something of an athlete,
went up the rope hand over hand, with his feet
against the rocks for added support.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now you go, Dick!&rdquo; cried Sam. &ldquo;If you are
weak and fall, I&rsquo;ll catch you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was quite a task for Dick to gain the rocks
at the top of the pool and once he came close to
giving up and slipping back into the water. But
he was gritty, and Tom assisted him by leaning
down on his breast and extending a helping hand.
Then Sam came up, and the three Rovers stood
beside the two men who had come to their
rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew! I am glad we are out of that!&rdquo; murmured
Sam, as he looked back at the cold and
gruesome waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to stay here!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;We
want to get after the Sobber crowd&mdash;before they
have a chance to leave the island!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can they leave the island?&rdquo; questioned
Sam. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they have a boat. I haven&rsquo;t
seen any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jerry Koswell&rsquo;s crowd has a boat, Sam&mdash;that
swift motor craft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they would aid such criminals as
Sobber and Crabtree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might&mdash;just to get the best of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the sooner we get after our enemies the
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are your pistols?&rdquo; asked the captain of
the steam tug.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mine was taken from me by Sobber,&rdquo; answered
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ours are at the bottom of the pool,&rdquo; added
Sam. &ldquo;We both dropped &rsquo;em when we plunged
into the water.&rdquo; And then he and his brothers
acquainted Captain Wells and the old sailor with
the particulars of their adventures since entering
the cavern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I still have my pistol!&rdquo; cried Captain
Wells, grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve got a good club,&rdquo; came from Larry
Dixon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can arm ourselves with clubs,&rdquo; said Dick.
&ldquo;But the main thing just now is to keep those
rascals in sight. If they slip us, there will be no
telling where they will go to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With eyes and ears on the alert, the whole party
made its way through the big cave, coming out of
the main opening, not far from where the campfire
still lay smouldering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly left in a hurry,&rdquo; remarked
Tom, as he gazed around. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t wait to
pick up all of their provisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they got scared,&rdquo; murmured Dick.
&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ll get more scared when they find we
are so close on their heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you suppose they went to?&rdquo; asked
the captain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But I think the best thing to do
is to go down to where that motor boat was tied
up. I don&rsquo;t think they can leave unless they use
that boat&mdash;unless, of course, they have some craft
we haven&rsquo;t as yet seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a well-defined path running from the
cave down to the shore of the island. This they
followed, through the patch of woods and over
some rocks. Then they came to an opening where
were located several dilapidated buildings. Not
far from one building were the remains of a recent
camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe this was the camp Darkingham and
those with him made!&rdquo; ejaculated Dick. &ldquo;They
have gone&mdash;maybe they have left the island!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, I don&rsquo;t like this!&rdquo; put in Tom, and
broke into a run for the old dock, and the others
followed on his heels.</p>
<p>They were still a hundred yards from the dock
when Tom let up a shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the motor boat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; questioned Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sobber crowd&mdash;and they have Mrs. Stanhope
with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; yelled Dick, at the top of his
voice. &ldquo;Stop, I tell you! Mrs. Stanhope!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; came from the lady, as she espied the
Rovers. &ldquo;Save me! Save me! Don&rsquo;t let them
take me further away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put on all speed!&rdquo; roared Tad Sobber, to
Pally, who was at the engine. &ldquo;Crowd her to the
limit! They are after us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we go! Hold fast everybody!&rdquo; answered
Pally, and the next moment the motor
boat shot out into the waters of Casco Bay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<h2 id="c30">CHAPTER XXX
<br /><span class="small">BACK HOME&mdash;CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Too late!&rdquo; groaned Dick. &ldquo;Oh, why didn&rsquo;t
we get here a minute sooner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, you rascals!&rdquo; sang out Captain Wells.
&ldquo;Stop, or I&rsquo;ll fire!&rdquo; and he raised his pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot! You might hit Mrs. Stanhope!&rdquo;
whispered Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only want to scare &rsquo;em,&rdquo; muttered the captain
of the steam tug.</p>
<p>The motor boat gathered headway rapidly, and
soon was out of range of the pistol. The Rovers
saw that the craft contained Tad Sobber, Jim
Pally, Josiah Crabtree and Mrs. Stanhope and
another woman, probably Mrs. Sobber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what has become of Koswell, Larkspur
and that Darkingham,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, and I don&rsquo;t care, just now!&rdquo; returned
Dick. &ldquo;Captain, we must follow that boat
without delay. If they get out of our sight we
may never get another chance to rescue Mrs.
Stanhope!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get after &rsquo;em as soon as I can,&rdquo; returned
the master of the steam tug.</p>
<p>But to start a pursuit was not so easy, from the
fact that the tug lay on the other side of the
island and could not be signalled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom and I can go after the tug,&rdquo; said Sam.
&ldquo;The rest of you can try to keep that motor boat
in sight;&rdquo; and so it was arranged.</p>
<p>The two Rover boys skirted the south end of
Chesoque Island. They kept on a run, and on
turning a corner of rocks, plumped fairly and
squarely into Koswell, Larkspur and Darkingham,
who were talking earnestly among themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They said they would send the boat back
sure,&rdquo; Koswell was saying, when Tom almost ran
him down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! you here!&rdquo; cried Tom, and then, as
Koswell grabbed him by the arm he added: &ldquo;Let
me go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast!&rdquo; roared Koswell. &ldquo;Bart, catch
the other fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo; muttered Bart Larkspur, and caught
Sam by the arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</div>
<p>What followed, came with such swiftness that
both Koswell and Larkspur were taken completely
off their guard. Tom drew back and hit Koswell
a blow in the nose that sent him staggering back
against the rocks and made the blood spurt freely.
Sam, seeing this, also struck out, reaching Larkspur&rsquo;s
left eye, and putting that optic in deep
mourning. Larkspur fell back on Darkingham,
and for the moment there was great confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skip! We don&rsquo;t want to be delayed!&rdquo; cried
Tom, to his brother, and on they went again, before
their enemies had time to recover.</p>
<p>Inside of five minutes they came in sight of the
steam tug. Those aboard were on the watch for
the return of Captain Wells, and the engineer had
a full head of steam up, to use in case of emergency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; cried Tom, as he and Sam rushed on
board. &ldquo;Captain Wells and my brother want you
on the other side of the island at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get there as quick as the propeller can
take us,&rdquo; said the mate, and the engineer nodded
to show that he understood. The tug backed
away from the island, and in a moment more was
on the way to the old dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say we gave Koswell and Larkspur something
to remember us by,&rdquo; remarked Sam, grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we did,&rdquo; answered Tom, with a grin.
&ldquo;Wish it had been ten times as much!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They and that Darkingham must have loaned
the motor boat to the Sobber crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely Sobber paid &rsquo;em well for its use.
He could do it easily&mdash;out of that fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the steam tug rounded the end of the island,
Tom and Sam were just able to see the motor boat
in the distance. It seemed to be heading for the
mainland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; sang out Tom, as they ran up to
the old dock. But this invitation was unnecessary,
for Dick, Captain Wells and Larry Dixon
leaped on the deck as soon as the craft was close
enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, after her!&rdquo; sang out the eldest
Rover boy. &ldquo;Crowd on all steam! I&rsquo;ll pay all expenses,
and more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if she blows up?&rdquo; queried the captain,
with a bit of dry humor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, even if she blows up, Captain! Oh, we
must catch them!&rdquo; added Dick, pleadingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do our level best, Mr. Rover. Nobody
could do more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon the throbbing of the engine showed that
the tug was running under a full pressure of
steam. The spray dashed all over the craft and
those on board, but to this nobody paid attention.
Every eye was riveted on the craft ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>Those on the motor boat were equally eager,
and watched the pursuit with chagrin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you&mdash;er&mdash;think they will catch us?&rdquo; asked
Josiah Crabtree, nervously, not once but several
times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I hope not,&rdquo; answered Pally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we run faster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am crowding her to the limit now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know about motor boats? Perhaps
Mr. Sobber knows more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Tad Sobber. &ldquo;Wish I
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know about &rsquo;em&mdash;I ran one for two summers,&rdquo;
answered Jim Pally. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave &rsquo;em behind
if it&rsquo;s in the boat to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please let me go!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Stanhope,
almost tearfully. &ldquo;Mr. Crabtree, I do not want
to go with you another step! Please let me go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet, Mrs. Stanhope, don&rsquo;t excite yourself,&rdquo;
he answered, trying to soothe her. But he
was so nervous his voice trembled as he spoke.
He had not dreamed that the pursuit would become
so swift and sure.</p>
<p>Closer and closer drew the steam tug, until
those on board could plainly see all that was taking
place on the motor boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I command you to stop!&rdquo; yelled Captain
Wells. &ldquo;Stop, or we&rsquo;ll run you down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">[283]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t you do that!&rdquo; screamed Josiah
Crabtree, in fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save me! Oh, save me!&rdquo; screamed Mrs.
Stanhope, and then, of a sudden, she sprang to
her feet, leaped to the stern deck of the motor
boat, and cast herself headlong into the waters of
the bay.</p>
<p>The movement was so unexpected by the others
on the <i>Magnet</i> that not a hand was raised to detain
her. She went down, directly in the path of
the oncoming tug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! Back her!&rdquo; screamed Dick, in horror,
and Tom and Sam also yelled out a warning.
There was a quick jangling of a bell, and the engine
was stopped. Then the power was reversed,
and the steam tug was steered to one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is!&rdquo; cried Tom, pointing with his
hand, and the next instant came a splash, as Dick
made a dive overboard. He, too, had seen Mrs.
Stanhope floating near, and soon he had her in
his arms and was supporting her.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/imag3.jpg" alt="&ldquo;THERE SHE IS!&rdquo; CRIED TOM! AND THE NEXT INSTANT CAME A SPLASH, AS DICK MADE A DIVE OVERBOARD." width="500" height="775" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;THERE SHE IS!&rdquo; CRIED TOM! AND THE NEXT INSTANT CAME A SPLASH, AS DICK MADE A DIVE OVERBOARD.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The engine of the tug was now stopped, and a
rope was thrown to the eldest Rover boy, and he
and Mrs. Stanhope were hauled on board. As the
lady was brought on deck, she fainted away, but
in a few minutes she recovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven, she is safe!&rdquo; murmured Dick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">[284]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thankful we didn&rsquo;t run her down!&rdquo; added
Captain Wells. &ldquo;It was a close shave! We had
to reverse like lightning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was well done, sir,&rdquo; answered Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t have been better,&rdquo; came from Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, say, aren&rsquo;t we going after those rascals?
Remember, even though we have rescued Mrs.
Stanhope, they still have the fortune!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, we are going after &rsquo;em!&rdquo; cried Dick.
&ldquo;Go ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The order to proceed was given, but, much to
the captain&rsquo;s chagrin, the tug refused to get up
any speed. Then came a report from the engineer
that the sudden reversing of the engine had
broken some of the machinery. They could run,
but it would have to be slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ll get away after all!&rdquo; groaned
Sam. &ldquo;And with that fortune, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortune?&rdquo; came from Mrs. Stanhope, who
was standing near the boiler, trying to dry her wet
garments. &ldquo;What about the fortune, boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t they got that fortune with them?&rdquo;
questioned Tom, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, they buried it, in the cave on the
island,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t know I
saw them, but I did. Tad Sobber and Mr. Crabtree
said they would come back, after&mdash;after&mdash;&rdquo;
And here she blushed deeply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">[285]</div>
<p>&ldquo;After old Crabtree had forced you to marry
him, I suppose,&rdquo; whispered Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dick. But, oh! I didn&rsquo;t want to do it!
He tried to hypnotize me, just as he tried to do
years ago&mdash;but I fought him off as best I could!&rdquo;
answered Mrs. Stanhope, earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to be in prison again!&rdquo; muttered
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the fortune is on the island, let us go and
get it,&rdquo; cried Sam. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t catch that motor
boat anyway!&rdquo; For the craft was now all but out
of sight.</p>
<p>The steam tug was headed for Chesoque Island,
and slowly made her way to the old dock. There
the engineer and his assistant set to work to make
the necessary repairs, while the three Rover boys
and Mrs. Stanhope visited the cave. Once in the
underground opening, the lady pointed out the
spot where the valise containing the fortune had
been secreted between the rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo; cried Tom, and dragged the valise
to light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open it and see if the fortune is safe!&rdquo; came
from Sam, in a voice he tried in vain to steady.</p>
<p>The key to the valise was missing, so the lock
to the bag had to be broken open. Inside were
the gold and precious stones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">[286]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All here&mdash;or at least the greater portion of it,&rdquo;
was Dick&rsquo;s comment, and he was right. Only
about five hundred dollars in gold was missing,
and two small diamonds&mdash;hardly worth mentioning
beside the total value of the treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve beaten them
after all! We&rsquo;ve got the treasure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mrs. Stanhope,&rdquo; added Dick. &ldquo;We must
send word to Dora and the others just as soon as
we can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity we didn&rsquo;t catch those rascals,&rdquo; murmured
Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll get them some time!&rdquo; said Dick.
How they fell in with their enemies again will be
related in another volume of this series, to be entitled,
&ldquo;The Rover Boys in the Air; or, From
College Campus to the Clouds,&rdquo; a tale telling the
particulars of several happenings far out of the
ordinary.</p>
<p>While the steam tug was laid up for repairs,
several of the party took a walk and looked for
Koswell, Larkspur and Darkingham. But they
looked in vain, for those rascals were thoroughly
frightened, and kept themselves well hidden in the
woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">[287]</div>
<p>That evening found the Rover boys and Mrs.
Stanhope in Portland, where they put up at one
of the leading hotels. Messages were sent to
Dora, the Lanings, and the Rovers at home, telling
of the rescue of Mrs. Stanhope, and of the
recovery of the fortune. Then Mrs. Stanhope
told how she had been lured from her home and
abducted, and then placed in the care of Mrs. Sobber,
and how she had managed to mail the postal
card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They treated me kindly enough,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;But they would not let me have my liberty, and I
think they told outsiders that I was insane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just what they did,&rdquo; answered Dick.</p>
<p>A general alarm was sent out for Sobber, Crabtree
and the others. But they kept in the dark
and were not captured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how glad I shall be to get back home!&rdquo;
murmured Mrs. Stanhope, when the return was
begun. &ldquo;It seems an age since I went away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dora will be glad to see you,&rdquo; answered Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owe you and your brothers a great deal,
Dick!&rdquo; she went on earnestly. &ldquo;You are all noble
young men!&rdquo; And this earnest praise made all of
the Rover boys blush.</p>
<p>The return to Cedarville was a great event.
Dora clasped her mother in her arms and laughed
and wept by turns, and then threw herself into
Dick&rsquo;s embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dick! It was splendid!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh,
I shall never forget it, never!&rdquo; And then she
kissed him right in front of everybody.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">[288]</div>
<p>The Lanings were equally pleased, and Nellie
and Grace were proud of the parts Tom and Sam
had played in the affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a regular hero!&rdquo; said Nellie to Tom,
and gave him a glance that thrilled him through
and through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we shall always remember what you
did!&rdquo; added Grace, to Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did better than the authorities,&rdquo; was Mr.
Anderson Rover&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The authorities did nothing,&rdquo; added Mr. Laning.
&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for your boys&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And
then he bobbed his head enthusiastically. &ldquo;Great
lads! fine lads!&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoop!&rdquo; cried Tom, in sudden high spirits,
and catching Sam by the arms and whirling him
around. &ldquo;Say, I suppose now we can go back
and finish that vacation, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing, Tom!&rdquo; cried Sam.</p>
<p>And then both set up a merry whistle; and here
let us take our leave and say good-bye.</p>
